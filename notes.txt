  Problem/Solution
    A.I.D.A brand name has to evolve into something that makes the value proposition clear
    The core problem is validated from my current experience as an educator in a district where technology facilitators are given a small stipend and responsible for keeping our school websites in order
    Innovation Roadmap: Smart calendars, personalized news feeds, third-party API integration
  Technical Architecture
    Leverage additional Convex components?
    Hybrid model approach or further research into other models that are cheaper and offer similar performance
    Authentication: Better Auth is now more feasible and important for scalability
    Design System: ShadCn offers solid accessible components, but there are other options available
    Explore other tools that may assist: Storybook, Mantine, etc.
  Next Steps
    There is still outdated information related to the Hackathon Demo
    I have received permission from my supervisor to attend ISTE conference in July of 2026. My development plan has to fit in this scope

  A sound, bulletproof strategy is in place.
  I may need to highlight the Next Steps and review this document on January 1, 2026.

  Ultimate Goal: Become intelligence layer for Education
  Backend Architecture is solid but now would be the time to swap out Convex Auth for Better Auth and it's limitless features and use calendars
  I have the unique opportunity as an educator in a district that has a very limited understanding of the power of AI and how it can solve most of our most glaring pain points. As a bonus, I am my school's technology facilitator and have a good rapport with our CTE supervisor. She sees me as a leader in the EdTech space
  My wins: technology, speed, cost, intelligence
  Final Site wins: brand, full generic suite, existing relationships
  Have to keep next steps in mind and focus on marketing/outreach over building more features. This will be a struggle for me!!!
