## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Vision
Pelican AI is an educator empowerment platform designed to become Louisiana's premier resource for ethical and effective AI usage in K-12 education. Rather than building another software platform, we are creating a comprehensive guidance system that helps educators leverage any AI platform they have access to (MagicSchool AI, Brisk, SchoolAI, Gemini, or others) to save time, reduce burnout, and improve instructional practice.

### 1.2 Mission Statement
