## üé® Design System

### Typography
- **Primary Font:** Inter - Used for all headings and body text
- **Usage:** Font styles managed via Tailwind utility classes

### Color Palette
- **Primary Colors:** 
  - Blue (#3B82F6) - Primary actions, voice interface, trust and reliability
  - Green (#10B981) - Success states, positive feedback, completion
  - Red (#EF4444) - Error states, warnings, critical actions
- **Secondary Colors:** 
  - Purple (#8B5CF6) - AI features, voice responses, innovation
  - Orange (#F59E0B) - Warnings, attention, important information

### Layout & Spacing
- **Grid System:** 12-column responsive grid with Tailwind CSS, mobile-first approach
- **Spacing Scale:** 4px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px (Tailwind spacing scale)
- **Voice Interface:** Extra spacing around voice elements for touch accessibility
