## 🎯 Project Foundation

### Mission Statement

To solve the critical problem of information overload faced by K-12 educators through a voice-enabled, context-aware AI assistant that provides district-specific knowledge and intelligent instructional feedback.

### Vision Statement

To become the indispensable AI-powered command center for educators, transforming how teachers access district information and receive instructional support, ultimately freeing up their time for meaningful student interaction.

### Core Philosophy: The A.I.D.A. Methodology

A.I.D.A. is built on the principle of "go deep, not wide" - focusing on hyper-contextualization and voice interface as defensible differentiators that competitors cannot easily replicate.

- **Phase 1: MVP Development** → Build and demonstrate core voice assistant and instructional feedback capabilities
- **Phase 2: Pilot & Validation** → Test with early adopter teachers and refine based on feedback  
- **Phase 3: District Rollout** → Scale to full district-wide implementation with enterprise features

### Current Project Status

- **Completion:** 15% (Foundation and planning phase)
- **Key Achievement:** Comprehensive MVP PRD completed with clear technical architecture
- **Next Phase:** Core MVP development focusing on voice interface and RAG pipeline
