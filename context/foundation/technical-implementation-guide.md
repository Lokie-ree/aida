- [ ] Empty, error, and loading states for each component are designed and documented
- [ ] Accessibility annotations (tab order, ARIA attributes) are included for voice components
- [ ] Voice interface states (listening, processing, speaking) are clearly defined

### Handoff Process

1. **Design Review:** The designer presents the finalized designs to the development team for feedback, including voice interface
2. **Handoff Meeting:** A formal meeting is held to walk through the designs and the handoff checklist
3. **Voice Interface Demo:** Special focus on voice interaction flows and accessibility requirements

## üìê Technical Decision-Making

This section outlines the formal process for evaluating and approving significant technical decisions, ensuring they are transparent and well-reasoned.

### Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

All significant technical decisions must be documented using an ADR. An ADR is a short text file that describes a specific problem, the proposed solution, and the trade-offs involved.

- **Title:** A descriptive name for the decision.
- **Date:** When the decision was made.
- **Status:** Proposed, Accepted, Rejected, or Superseded.
- **Context:** The technical and business factors that led to the problem.
- **Decision:** The chosen solution and the reasoning behind it.
- **Consequences:** The positive and negative impacts of the decision.

### Review Process

1. **Proposal:** The technical lead or engineer proposes a new architecture or technology via an ADR
2. **Review:** The ADR is reviewed by relevant stakeholders (e.g., System Architect, Senior Engineers)
3. **Voice Interface Consideration:** Special consideration for voice interface impact and accessibility
4. **Discussion:** The team discusses the trade-offs and potential risks, especially for demo requirements
5. **Decision & Documentation:** Once a consensus is reached, the ADR is finalized and committed to the project repository
