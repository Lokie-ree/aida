# A.I.D.A. Project Guide

**Last Updated:** September 23, 2025  
**Owner:** Product Manager  
**Purpose:** Complete project foundation, business strategy, and operational planning

## üéØ Project Foundation

### Mission Statement
To solve the critical problem of information overload faced by K-12 educators through a voice-enabled, context-aware AI assistant that provides district-specific knowledge and intelligent instructional feedback.

### Vision Statement
To become the indispensable AI-powered command center for educators, transforming how teachers access district information and receive instructional support, ultimately freeing up their time for meaningful student interaction.

### Core Philosophy: The A.I.D.A. Methodology
A.I.D.A. is built on the principle of "go deep, not wide" - focusing on hyper-contextualization and voice interface as defensible differentiators that competitors cannot easily replicate.

## üë• User Personas

### Primary Persona: K-12 Educator (Sarah)
- **Role:** Classroom teacher, curriculum coordinator, or department head
- **Goals:** Quick access to district policies, improved lesson plans, reduced administrative burden
- **Pain Points:** Information overload, time-consuming searches, lack of personalized feedback
- **Voice Interface:** Prefers hands-free operation for quick queries while multitasking

### Secondary Personas

#### School District Administrator (Michael)
- **Goals:** Improve teacher efficiency, ensure policy compliance, demonstrate ROI
- **Key Quote:** "I need tools that actually solve real problems for our teachers, not just add to their workload."

#### Curriculum Coordinator (Jennifer)
- **Goals:** Ensure curriculum alignment, support teacher development, maintain quality standards
- **Key Quote:** "Teachers need quick access to curriculum guidance without having to dig through multiple documents."

#### New Teacher (David)
- **Goals:** Learn district policies quickly, improve teaching effectiveness, gain confidence
- **Key Quote:** "I need help understanding what I'm supposed to do without bothering my colleagues constantly."

## üè¢ Competitive Analysis

### Key Competitive Advantages
- **Hyper-Contextualization:** District-specific knowledge that general-purpose tools cannot provide
- **Voice Interface:** Hands-free, conversational experience unmatched by competitors
- **Integrated Suite:** Cohesive command center vs. fragmented single-purpose tools
- **FERPA Compliance:** Self-hosted architecture with complete data ownership

### Primary Competitors
- **Khanmigo:** Free lesson planning but no district context or voice interface
- **MagicSchool AI:** 50+ tools but no voice interface or district contextualization
- **Brisk Teaching:** Google integration but limited scope and no voice interface
- **TeacherMatic:** Comprehensive tools but no voice interface or district focus
- **Google Classroom:** Massive user base but not voice-first or district-specific

## üöÄ Strategic Priorities

### Revenue Model
- **Strategy:** Hybrid B2B2C model - freemium for individual teachers, enterprise licensing for districts
- **Target Conversion:** 15% of free users upgrade to Pro within 90 days
- **ARPU Goals:** $50/month per teacher (Pro), $10,000/year per district (Enterprise)
- **Growth Strategy:** Bottom-up adoption through teachers, then top-down enterprise sales to districts

### Success Metrics
- **Business:** MRR growth, user acquisition cost, customer lifetime value
- **Engagement:** Daily active users, voice queries per session, lesson plan uploads
- **Technical:** Voice response time <2s, RAG accuracy >90%, system uptime 99.9%

## üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP Development (Hackathon - 3 days)
- **Goal:** Build and demonstrate core voice assistant and instructional feedback capabilities
- **Key Deliverables:** 
  - Voice-enabled district assistant with Vapi integration
  - AI-powered lesson plan feedback system
  - Basic dashboard with Convex backend
  - RAG pipeline with Firecrawl document ingestion
  - Working demo for hackathon judges

### Phase 2: Pilot & Validation (Post-Hackathon - 3 months)  
- **Goal:** Validate product-market fit with early adopter teachers
- **Key Deliverables:** 
  - Refined voice interface based on user feedback
  - Enhanced RAG accuracy and response quality
  - Teacher onboarding flow and documentation
  - Pilot program with 10-20 teachers
  - Case study and success metrics

### Phase 3: District Rollout (6-12 months)
- **Goal:** Scale to full district-wide implementation with enterprise features
- **Key Deliverables:** 
  - Enterprise authentication and security
  - Advanced analytics and reporting
  - District-wide document ingestion
  - Custom integrations and APIs
  - Full sales and support team

## üìù Task Management

### Current Sprint (Hackathon Focus)
| Task | Priority | Status | Notes |
|------|----------|--------|-------|
| Set up Convex backend with RAG component | P0 | To Do | Core infrastructure for MVP |
| Integrate Vapi for voice interface | P0 | To Do | Essential for voice assistant demo |
| Implement Firecrawl for document ingestion | P0 | To Do | Required for district-specific knowledge |
| Build basic dashboard UI | P0 | To Do | User interface for MVP demo |
| Create lesson plan feedback system | P0 | To Do | Core feature for instructional support |
| Test with sample district documents | P1 | To Do | Validation before demo |
| Prepare compelling demo script | P1 | To Do | Critical for hackathon success |

## ‚öñÔ∏è Risk Assessment

### Risk 1: Voice Interface Latency Issues
**Mitigation:** Vapi optimization, fallback to text interface, clear speaking guidelines for demo

### Risk 2: RAG Accuracy Problems
**Mitigation:** Multiple document sources, fact-checking, human-in-the-loop validation

### Risk 3: Integration Complexity
**Mitigation:** Thorough testing, backup systems, simplified demo flow

### Risk 4: Demo Technical Failures
**Mitigation:** Offline mode preparation, backup internet, pre-recorded demo video

### Risk 5: Limited Time for Development
**Mitigation:** Focus on core features only, leverage existing components, prioritize demo-ready functionality

## üìã Assumptions & Constraints

### Core Assumptions
- Teachers will adopt voice interface for quick queries
- Districts will pay for enterprise features that save teacher time
- RAG accuracy will be sufficient for policy questions
- Voice technology is mature enough for reliable demo
- Teachers have access to district documents for ingestion

### Constraints
- 3-day hackathon timeline limits feature scope
- Limited budget for external services during development
- Need to demonstrate 5+ sponsor technology integrations
- Must create compelling demo within time constraints
- Voice recognition accuracy depends on environment
