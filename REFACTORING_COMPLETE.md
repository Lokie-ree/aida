## Key Architectural Changes

### Before (Complex)
```
District Websites → Firecrawl → RAG → Voice Interface
                                   ↓
                          Lesson Plans → Feedback
```

### After (Focused)
```
District Documents (Upload) → RAG → Voice Interface → All Stakeholders
                                          ↓
                                   Source Citations

## New Value Proposition

### Previous

## Updated Demo Strategy

### Multi-Stakeholder Journeys

2. **Parent (Maria):** "What time does the bus arrive at Maple Street?" → Quick answer from home
3. **Administrator (Michael):** "Summarize our student wellness goals" → Brief for board meeting

**Key Message:** One voice for the entire district
