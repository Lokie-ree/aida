      "content": "A great design is about more than just aesthetics; it's about telling a story and solving a problem with clarity and a touch of magic. Given A.I.D.A.'s mission and your goal of creating a winning hackathon entry, the design should embody a core philosophy: \"Invisible Intelligence, Empathic Design.\" The goal is to build a user interface that is so intuitive and responsive, it feels like a natural extension of a teacher's mind, not another tool to learn.\n\nHere is a design brief for a \"sick\" A.I.D.A. hackathon prototype, built on the project's core strengths and your innovative ideas:",
      "philosophy": {
        "title": "Design Philosophy: Bold Simplicity Meets Human Empathy",
        "description": "The design should be a direct evolution of the project's existing philosophy, prioritizing \"bold simplicity\" and \"breathable whitespace\". We will leverage the project's established color palette—using purple to highlight AI-powered features and blue for core interactions—to create a visual language that is clean, trustworthy, and innovative. The design's secret weapon will be its real-time responsiveness to the user's emotional state, moving beyond a static interface to one that genuinely supports the multitasking educator."

In response, the interface could automatically simplify, reducing on-screen clutter to present only the most critical information, offering a calming, focused experience."

If the teacher sounds frustrated while asking about a district policy, A.I.D.A. could respond with a simplified, calming answer rather than a long, technical document. This shows a deeper level of intelligence beyond simple retrieval."

As the user scrolls, the chaotic \"data overload\" particles would visibly coalesce and organize themselves into a clean, structured visualization, embodying the project's mission to bring order to information chaos. This provides a mesmerizing, immersive experience that explains the technology without a single line of text."
