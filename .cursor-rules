# A.I.D.A. Project Rules

## Documentation Reference

Before starting any task, agents MUST reference the complete project documentation in `@./docs`:

- **Primary Configuration**: `@./docs/AIDA_CONFIG.yaml` - Complete project specification, user personas, technical architecture, and agent roles
- **Hackathon Specifications**: `@./docs/hackathon/hackathon-specs.json` - Design philosophy, landing page requirements, and MVP features

## Current MVP Status (3 Days to Demo)

**Built Features Only:**

- ✅ Voice Interface with Vapi integration (working voice-to-text/text-to-speech)
- ✅ AI Lesson Plan Feedback system (text input → AI feedback)
- ✅ Document Manager (upload .txt/.md files for RAG)
- ✅ Web Scraping Manager (Firecrawl integration)
- ✅ Workspace/Spaces system (personal + shared workspaces)
- ✅ Chat Interface (text-based queries)
- ✅ Authentication system (Convex Auth)

**NOT Built (Do Not Mention):**

- ❌ Voice Orb with stateful design (idle/listening/success states)
- ❌ Empathy Bar with emotional analysis
- ❌ Classroom Dynamics Widget
- ❌ Speaker diarization
- ❌ Advanced analytics dashboard
- ❌ District-specific contextualization beyond basic RAG

## Marketing & Content Rules

1. **Only promote built features** - No speculative features
2. **Target user personas**: K-12 Educators, District Administrators, Curriculum Coordinators
3. **Focus on value proposition**: Voice-enabled AI assistant for educational information overload
4. **Avoid hackathon participant language** - This is for end users, not event participants

## Design System

- **Colors**: Blue (#3B82F6) for primary actions, Purple (#8B5CF6) for AI features
- **Typography**: Inter font family
- **Voice Interface**: Hands-free operation, mobile-first design
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Convex (real-time DB + serverless functions)
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
- **Voice**: Vapi integration
- **Auth**: Convex Auth (FERPA-compliant)

## Agent Coordination

Follow the agent roles defined in AIDA_CONFIG.yaml:

- Product Manager: User stories and business strategy
- System Architect: Technical architecture
- UX Designer: Voice-first interface design
- Backend Engineer: Convex implementation
- Frontend Engineer: React components

## Quality Gates

- All features must be testable and demonstrable
- Voice interface must work in <2 seconds
- Mobile-responsive design required
- FERPA compliance for all data handling
