## Quality Standards

### Bug Reporting
- All bugs include: Steps to Reproduce, Expected vs Actual Result, visual evidence
- Priority assigned based on user impact (Critical = blocks beta launch)
- Severity reflects technical impact (Blocker = system unusable)
- Louisiana educator context included when relevant

### Test Coverage
- **Phase 1 Critical Paths:** 100% coverage
- **Happy Path Scenarios:** All user stories validated
- **Error Scenarios:** Invalid inputs, network failures, timeout handling
- **Edge Cases:** Empty states, max character limits, special characters
- **Cross-Device:** Mobile (iOS/Android), Desktop (Windows/Mac), Tablet

### Acceptance Criteria Validation
- Every User Story acceptance criterion has corresponding test case
- All P0 test cases must pass before beta launch
- Performance targets validated (<3s load time, <10s email delivery)
- Accessibility audit passes (WCAG AA)

## Current Test Status

### Test Success Rate: 72.7%

**Passing Tests ✅**
- ✅ Beta signup flow
- ✅ User profile creation
- ✅ Email automation (welcome, weekly prompts)
- ✅ Database operations (CRUD)
- ✅ Basic authentication flows

**Failing Tests ❌**
- ❌ Better Auth HTTP endpoints (404/CORS errors - 27.3% of tests)
- ❌ Session management edge cases
- ❌ Integration tests (auth initialization)
- ❌ Some API endpoint tests (convex/http.ts routes)

### Phase 2 Testing Scope
- Backend functionality: Already tested and working (convex/*.ts functions)
- UI components: Built but not user-facing (need integration tests for exposure)
- E2E flows: Need new test cases for framework library, community features, dashboard

### Critical QA Priorities
1. **Fix failing auth endpoint tests** (target: 90%+ success rate)
2. **Create integration tests for Phase 2 UI exposure** (routing, data wiring)
3. **Validate framework library user flows** (search, filter, copy prompt, track time)
4. **Test community features end-to-end** (submit innovation, approve testimonial)
5. **Cross-device validation for Phase 2 UI** (mobile-first framework browsing)

## Risk-Based Testing Framework (From PRD)

### Technical Risks - Test Coverage
- **Authentication Issues (Medium - Active Blocker):**
  - Priority: P0 - All auth endpoint tests must pass
  - Test Cases: Session management, CORS handling, endpoint availability
  - Exit Criteria: 100% auth test success rate
  
- **Scalability (Low - Monitor at 100+ users):**
  - Priority: P1 - Load testing for beta scale
  - Test Cases: Concurrent users, database query performance, email queue
  - Exit Criteria: <3s page load with 100+ concurrent users
  
- **Email Deliverability (Low - Monitor open rates):**
  - Priority: P1 - Email testing across clients
  - Test Cases: Gmail/Outlook/Apple Mail rendering, spam filter avoidance
  - Exit Criteria: >95% delivery rate, >75% open rate

### Business Risks - UAT Focus
- **User Adoption (Medium):**
  - Test signup friction, time-to-value, mobile experience
  - User acceptance criteria: <2 min signup, immediate value (welcome email)
  
- **Competition (High - Maintain Differentiation):**
  - Test platform-agnostic messaging, Louisiana branding prominence
  - Validate "Works with ANY AI tool" is clear throughout UI
  
- **FERPA Compliance (Low - Built-in):**
  - Audit all PII handling, verify no data leaks in logs/errors
  - Test data access controls, audit logging functionality

## Phase 3+ Testing Preparation (From PRD)

### Future Features - Test Infrastructure
- **RAG-Powered Features:** Prepare vector search tests, document processing validation
- **Voice Interface:** Audio E2E tests, Vapi integration testing
- **Advanced Analytics:** Data accuracy tests, aggregation validation
- **Mobile App:** React Native testing setup, API compatibility tests
- **District Partnerships:** SSO integration tests, multi-tenant validation

### Long-Term Test Strategy
- **Scalability Testing:** 100+ users → 1000+ users load tests
- **Revenue Features:** Payment flow tests, subscription management
- **Multi-State:** Localization testing, state-specific content validation
