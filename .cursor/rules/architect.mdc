## Core User Stories

### USER-001: Beta Onboarding Journey
As a Louisiana educator,
I want a simple signup and approval process with immediate value (welcome email),
So that I can start using AI guidance without technical barriers.

**Architecture Requirements:**
- < 2 minute signup flow (form validation, auth, profile creation)
- <24-48 hour approval with automated notification
- <10 second email delivery (Resend integration)
- Mobile-responsive design (viewport optimization)

### USER-002: Weekly Prompt Engagement
As a Louisiana educator,
I want weekly AI framework prompts delivered via email,
So that I can save 10+ minutes per prompt and improve my teaching practice.

**Architecture Requirements:**
- Reliable cron job (Convex scheduler, Monday 6am CT)
- Louisiana standards alignment (framework metadata)
- Platform-agnostic prompt design (works with any AI tool)
- Email tracking and analytics (open rates, engagement)

## Architecture Principles

### Serverless-First
- Leverage Convex for all backend operations (database, functions, scheduling)
- Zero server management overhead
- Auto-scaling for Louisiana educator load patterns
- Pay-per-use cost model

### End-to-End Type Safety
- TypeScript strict mode throughout
- Convex-generated types for database schema
- Shared types between frontend and backend
- Runtime validation with Zod/validators

### Zero-Trust Security
- FERPA compliance for educator data
- Better Auth for authentication and session management
- Input validation on all API boundaries
- Audit logging for sensitive operations

### Performance Targets
- **Page Load:** <3 seconds on 3G connection
- **Email Delivery:** <10 seconds for transactional emails
- **API Response:** <500ms for critical operations
- **Uptime:** 99%+ during MVP period

### Platform-Agnostic Architecture (From PRD)
**Core Principle:** Pelican AI is **guidance, not a tool** - architecture must support ANY AI platform

- **No Vendor Lock-In:** Framework library works with MagicSchool AI, Brisk, SchoolAI, Gemini, ChatGPT, etc.
- **Prompt Portability:** All prompts are copy-paste ready for any AI tool
- **Louisiana-First:** Metadata includes Louisiana standards alignment for all frameworks
- **Ethical Guardrails:** Built into framework design, not tool-specific

**Architecture Implications:**
- Framework schema must be tool-agnostic (no tool-specific fields)
- Prompt templates use universal patterns (avoid tool-specific syntax)
- Community features showcase tool flexibility (educators share which tools work best)
- Analytics track effectiveness across tools, not tool usage

## Risk Framework for Architecture Decisions (From PRD)

### Technical Risks
- **Authentication Issues:** Better Auth HTTP endpoint problems (Medium - active blocker)
  - *Architecture Mitigation:* Session management redesign, fallback auth patterns
- **Scalability:** Convex limits with high user growth (Low - monitor at 100+ users)
  - *Architecture Mitigation:* Query optimization, pagination, data sharding strategies
- **Email Deliverability:** Resend reputation management (Low - monitor open rates)
  - *Architecture Mitigation:* Email queue management, retry logic, deliverability monitoring

### Business Risks (Architecture Impact)
- **User Adoption:** Slow beta signup rate (Medium)
  - *Architecture Response:* Optimize signup flow performance, reduce friction
- **Competition:** Large AI companies entering education (High)
  - *Architecture Defense:* Maintain platform-agnostic flexibility, Louisiana customization
- **Regulatory:** FERPA compliance requirements (Low - built-in from day one)
  - *Architecture Mandate:* Zero-trust security, data encryption, audit logging

### Risk-Based Architecture Decisions
Before finalizing architecture, assess:
1. **FERPA Compliance:** Does this design introduce data exposure risks?
2. **Platform Agnostic:** Does this architecture lock educators into specific AI tools?
3. **Scalability:** Can Convex handle this at 100+ users? 1000+ users?
4. **Technical Debt:** Will this create maintenance burden or block Phase 3+ features?

## Current System State

### Implemented & Working
- ✅ Convex backend (all tables, 80+ functions across convex/*.ts files)
- ✅ Better Auth integration (auth flows work, HTTP endpoints problematic)
- ✅ Resend email automation (welcome, weekly prompts)
- ✅ Database schema complete (Phase 1 + Phase 2 tables in convex/schema.ts)
- ✅ RAG system (@convex-dev/rag component, tables auto-managed)
- ✅ Vapi integration (convex/vapi.ts, @vapi-ai/web v2.4.0)
- ✅ Firecrawl integration (@mendable/firecrawl-js v1.29.3)

### Known Technical Issues
1. **Better Auth HTTP Endpoints**: CORS/404 errors on some endpoints (blocking 27.3% of tests)
2. **Session Sync**: Occasional session synchronization issues between Better Auth and Convex
3. **Test Coverage**: 72.7% success rate (target: 90%+, auth endpoint tests failing)
