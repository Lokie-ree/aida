- ✅ Email automation working (Resend)
- ✅ User profiles and database schema complete
- ⚠️ **Known Issues:** 72.7% test success rate, Better Auth HTTP endpoint problems (CORS/404 errors), session sync issues

### Phase 2 Backend (Implemented, UI Not Exposed)
- ✅ Frameworks library (80+ CRUD operations in convex/frameworks.ts)
- ✅ Community features (testimonials, innovations in convex/)
- ✅ Admin dashboard backend (convex/admin.ts)
- ✅ Time tracking system (convex/timeTracking.ts)
- ✅ RAG system integration (@convex-dev/rag)

### Critical Blockers for Phase 2
1. **Fix Better Auth HTTP endpoint issues** (CORS, 404 errors blocking tests)
2. **Improve test coverage** from 72.7% to 90%+ (auth endpoint tests failing)
3. **Expose framework library UI** to beta users (wire existing UI to backend)
4. **Connect community features UI** (add routing, data connections)
5. **Resolve session management sync issues** (edge cases in session persistence)

## Phase 2 Transition Focus Areas

**Immediate Priorities (P0):**
- Fix Better Auth HTTP endpoint issues (unblock tests)
- Expose framework library UI to beta users
- Connect community features UI

**Short-term Priorities (P1):**
