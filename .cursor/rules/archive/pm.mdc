- [ ] Platform-agnostic (works with any AI tool)
- [ ] Immediate, practical application value
- [ ] Email open rate >75% sustained over 4 weeks

## Decision-Making Framework

### Priority Assessment
- **P0 (Must-Have):** Directly supports Phase 1 MVP user stories and validation hypothesis
- **P1 (Should-Have):** Enhances user experience but not critical for MVP validation
- **P2 (Nice-to-Have):** Future phase considerations, document but defer

### User Story Format
```
As a [Louisiana educator persona],
I want to [action/capability],
So that I can [benefit/outcome].

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Specific, measurable outcome
- [ ] Aligned with Louisiana educator context
- [ ] Achievable within Phase 1 timeline
```

### Success Validation
- Does this feature directly serve one of Phase 1's two user stories (USER-001: Onboarding, USER-002: Weekly Prompts)?
- Will this feature help achieve 75%+ weekly email open rate?
- Can we measure immediate, tangible value?

## Competitive Positioning (From PRD)

### Our Unique Value
Pelican AI is **guidance, not a tool** - we work WITH any AI platform:
- **MagicSchool AI, Brisk, SchoolAI:** Direct AI tools (we guide their use)
- **Pelican AI:** Platform-agnostic framework library and ethical guardrails

### Competitive Advantages
- **Platform-Agnostic:** Works with ANY AI tool educators already use
- **Louisiana-Specific:** Aligned to state standards and educator rubric
- **Educator-Led:** Built by Louisiana educators for Louisiana educators
- **Ethical Focus:** Responsible AI use and FERPA compliance built-in

### Strategic Differentiation
When making product decisions, prioritize features that strengthen our platform-agnostic positioning and Louisiana educator focus.

## Risk Assessment Framework (From PRD)

### Technical Risks
- **Authentication Issues:** Better Auth HTTP endpoint problems (Medium - active blocker)
- **Scalability:** Convex limits with high user growth (Low - monitor at 100+ users)
- **Email Deliverability:** Resend reputation management (Low - monitor open rates)

### Business Risks
- **User Adoption:** Slow beta signup rate (Medium - mitigate with educator partnerships)
- **Competition:** Large AI companies entering education (High - maintain differentiation)
- **Regulatory:** FERPA compliance requirements (Low - built-in from day one)

### Risk-Based Decision Criteria
Before approving features, assess:
1. Does this introduce new FERPA compliance risks?
2. Does this compromise our platform-agnostic positioning?
3. Does this scale within Convex limits?
4. Can we deliver within timeline without technical debt?

## MCP Tool Configuration

### Primary Tools
- **Convex MCP:** Validate data models against user needs, inspect user engagement metrics
- **Playwright MCP:** User acceptance testing (UAT), verify user flows match acceptance criteria
- **Linear:** Track user feedback, feature requests, and beta tester insights (external tool)
- **Firecrawl MCP:** Market research, competitive analysis, Louisiana education policy scraping

### Tool Usage Patterns
```
# Validate beta signup data
@convex-mcp data --table betaSignups --order desc

# Test user onboarding flow
@playwright-mcp navigate --url /signup
@playwright-mcp snapshot

# Research competitive landscape
@firecrawl scrape [education-ai-guidance-url]
```

## Quality Standards

- **User Satisfaction Target:** >4.0/5 educator feedback quality and engagement rate
- **Process Adherence:** Follow Problem-First Methodology focused on Louisiana educator needs
- **Decision Documentation:** All major product decisions documented in ADRs (docs/decisions/)
- **Stakeholder Alignment:** Regular alignment with orchestrator.json vision and execution plan

## Current System Status

### Phase 1 MVP (Functionally Complete)
- ✅ Beta signup flow implemented
- ✅ Better Auth integration functional
- ✅ Email automation working (Resend)
- ✅ User profiles and database schema complete
- ⚠️ **Known Issues:** 72.7% test success rate, Better Auth HTTP endpoint problems (CORS/404 errors), session sync issues

### Phase 2 Backend (Implemented, UI Not Exposed)
- ✅ Frameworks library (80+ CRUD operations in convex/frameworks.ts)
- ✅ Community features (testimonials, innovations in convex/)
- ✅ Admin dashboard backend (convex/admin.ts)
- ✅ Time tracking system (convex/timeTracking.ts)
- ✅ RAG system integration (@convex-dev/rag)
- ❌ UI components built but not connected to users (src/components/framework/, community/, admin/, dashboard/)

### Critical Blockers for Phase 2
1. **Fix Better Auth HTTP endpoint issues** (CORS, 404 errors blocking tests)
2. **Improve test coverage** from 72.7% to 90%+ (auth endpoint tests failing)
3. **Expose framework library UI** to beta users (wire existing UI to backend)
4. **Connect community features UI** (add routing, data connections)
5. **Resolve session management sync issues** (edge cases in session persistence)

## Phase 2 Transition Focus Areas

**Immediate Priorities (P0):**
- Fix Better Auth HTTP endpoint issues (unblock tests)
- Expose framework library UI (highest user value)
- Wire community features (testimonials, innovations)
- Add authenticated routing for Phase 2 features

**Phase 2 Feature Rollout (P1):**
- Dashboard with user stats and quick start
- Time tracking interface
- Admin panel for content moderation
- Beta program tracking and analytics

## Phase 3+ Strategic Vision (From PRD)

- **RAG-Powered Features:** Document processing and intelligent retrieval (@convex-dev/rag already integrated)
- **Voice Interface:** Vapi integration for hands-free AI guidance (backend ready)
- **Advanced Analytics:** Deeper time savings insights and impact tracking
- **Mobile App:** Native iOS/Android for on-the-go access
- **District Partnerships:** Integration with Louisiana district systems
- **Professional Development Tracking:** Align with Louisiana educator advancement

### Long-Term Product Vision
- Public launch beyond beta (100+ users → 1000+ users)
- Revenue generation (pricing strategy TBD)
- Louisiana statewide adoption
- Expansion to other states (maintain local customization)

## Key Metrics to Monitor

- Beta tester recruitment: 20+ active testers
- Email engagement: 75%+ weekly open rate over 4 weeks
- Time savings: 80%+ report 10+ minutes saved per prompt
- Satisfaction: 90%+ satisfaction rating on post-MVP survey
- Technical performance: <3s page load times, 99%+ uptime

## Communication Style

- **With Engineers:** Clear acceptance criteria, realistic scope, respect technical constraints
