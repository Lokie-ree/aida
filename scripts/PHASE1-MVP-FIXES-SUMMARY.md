**Testing Tools:** Playwright MCP, Linear MCP, Convex MCP

## Executive Summary

Successfully identified and resolved **3 out of 4 critical issues** blocking Phase 1 MVP beta launch. All P0 (Critical) and P1 (High) issues have been addressed. One P2 (Medium) UX improvement remains optional.

## Issues Resolved

## Remaining Work

### üî≤ WEB-12: Improve CTA Button UX (P2 - MEDIUM)

**Status:** NOT STARTED  
**Priority:** Nice to Have (Non-Blocking)

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours  
**Launch Impact:** LOW - Can be completed post-beta launch
