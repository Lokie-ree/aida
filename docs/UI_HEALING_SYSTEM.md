## üßÆ Step 3: Calculate Composite Score

**Formula:**
```
Total Score = (Brand √ó 0.20) + (Design System √ó 0.25) + (Accessibility √ó 0.25) + (UX √ó 0.20) + (Responsive √ó 0.10)
```

**Example:**
- Brand Alignment: 9/10 √ó 0.20 = 1.8
- Design System: 8/10 √ó 0.25 = 2.0
- Accessibility: 7/10 √ó 0.25 = 1.75
- User Experience: 9/10 √ó 0.20 = 1.8
- Responsive: 8/10 √ó 0.10 = 0.8
- **Total: 8.15/10** ‚úÖ (Passes threshold)

**Thresholds:**
- **9.0-10.0:** Excellent - Minor polish only
- **8.0-8.9:** Good - Small refinements needed
- **7.0-7.9:** Acceptable - Moderate improvements needed
- **< 7.0:** Needs significant work - Proceed to Step 4

## üîß Step 4: Identify & Prioritize Issues

For any screen/component scoring **< 8.0**, create an issue list:

### Issue Template
```markdown
**Component:** [Name]
**Score:** [X/10]
**Category:** [Brand/Design System/Accessibility/UX/Responsive]
**Priority:** [P0/P1/P2]
**Issue:** [Specific problem]
**Expected:** [What it should be]
**Fix:** [Proposed solution]
**Reference:** [Link to design doc/guideline]
```

### Priority Levels
- **P0 (Critical):** Accessibility barriers, brand violations, broken functionality
- **P1 (High):** Design system violations, poor UX, responsive issues
- **P2 (Medium):** Polish, minor inconsistencies, nice-to-haves

---

## ‚ú® Step 5: Implement Fixes

### 5.1 Make Changes
For each identified issue:
1. Reference the appropriate design documentation
2. Update the component code
3. Test in browser at multiple breakpoints
4. Verify accessibility with keyboard navigation
5. Check dark mode (if applicable)

### 5.2 Document Changes
Update the component file with:
```typescript
/**
 * [Component Name]
 * 
 * Design System Compliance: ‚úì
 * Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA ‚úì
 * Responsive: Mobile-first ‚úì
 * 
 * Last Audit: [Date]
 * Score: [X/10]
 */
```

## üîÑ Step 6: Re-Audit

After implementing fixes:
1. **Repeat Step 1:** Capture new screenshots
2. **Repeat Step 2:** Re-grade against criteria
3. **Verify improvement:** New score should be ‚â• 8.0
4. **If still < 8.0:** Return to Step 4 and refine further

**Success Criteria:**
- All screens/components score ‚â• 8.0
- No P0 issues remaining
- All P1 issues resolved or documented for future sprint
- P2 issues tracked in backlog

---

## üìù Step 7: Document Results

Create an audit report:

```markdown
# UI/UX Audit Report
**Date:** [Date]
**Auditor:** [Name]
**Scope:** [Screens/components audited]

## Summary
- **Total Components Audited:** [N]
- **Average Score:** [X/10]
- **Components Passing (‚â•8.0):** [N]
- **Components Needing Work (<8.0):** [N]

## Detailed Scores
| Component | Brand | Design | A11y | UX | Responsive | Total |
|-----------|-------|--------|------|----|-----------| ------|
| Landing   | 9/10  | 8/10   | 7/10 | 9/10| 8/10     | 8.2   |
| Dashboard | 8/10  | 9/10   | 8/10 | 8/10| 9/10     | 8.4   |
| ...       | ...   | ...    | ...  | ... | ...      | ...   |
