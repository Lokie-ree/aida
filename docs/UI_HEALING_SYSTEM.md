## üßÆ Step 3: Calculate Composite Score

**Formula:**
```
Total Score = (Brand √ó 0.25) + (Design System √ó 0.25) + (Accessibility √ó 0.25) + (UX √ó 0.15) + (Responsive √ó 0.10)
```

**Example:**
- Brand Alignment: 9/10 √ó 0.25 = 2.25
- Design System: 8/10 √ó 0.25 = 2.0
- Accessibility: 7/10 √ó 0.25 = 1.75
- User Experience: 9/10 √ó 0.15 = 1.35
- Responsive: 8/10 √ó 0.10 = 0.8
- **Total: 8.15/10** ‚úÖ (Passes threshold)

**Thresholds:**
- **9.0-10.0:** Excellent - Minor polish only
- **8.0-8.9:** Good - Small refinements needed
- **7.0-7.9:** Acceptable - Moderate improvements needed
- **< 7.0:** Needs significant work - Proceed to Step 4

## üîß Step 4: Identify & Prioritize Issues

For any screen/component scoring **< 8.0**, create an issue list:

### Issue Template
```markdown
**Component:** [Name]
**Score:** [X/10]
**Category:** [Brand/Design System/Accessibility/UX/Responsive]
**Priority:** [P0/P1/P2]
**Issue:** [Specific problem]
**Expected:** [What it should be]
**Fix:** [Proposed solution]
**Reference:** [Link to design doc/guideline]
```

### Priority Levels
- **P0 (Critical):** Accessibility barriers, brand violations, broken functionality, email template issues
- **P1 (High):** Design system violations, poor UX, responsive issues, Louisiana educator context missing
- **P2 (Medium):** Polish, minor inconsistencies, nice-to-haves

---

## ‚ú® Step 5: Implement Fixes

### 5.1 Make Changes
For each identified issue:
1. Reference the orchestrator.json brand guidelines and Phase 1 MVP scope
2. Update the component code
3. Test in browser at multiple breakpoints
4. Verify accessibility with keyboard navigation
5. Test email templates across devices and email clients
6. Ensure Louisiana educator context is maintained

### 5.2 Document Changes
Update the component file with:
```typescript
/**
 * [Component Name] - Phase 1 MVP
 * 
 * Design System Compliance: ‚úì
 * Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA ‚úì
 * Responsive: Mobile-first ‚úì
 * Louisiana Educator Context: ‚úì
 * Email Template: ‚úì (if applicable)
 * 
 * Last Audit: [Date]
 * Score: [X/10]
 * Phase: 1 MVP
 */
```

## üîÑ Step 6: Re-Audit

After implementing fixes:
1. **Repeat Step 1:** Capture new screenshots
2. **Repeat Step 2:** Re-grade against criteria
3. **Verify improvement:** New score should be ‚â• 8.0
4. **If still < 8.0:** Return to Step 4 and refine further

**Success Criteria:**
- All screens/components score ‚â• 8.0
- No P0 issues remaining
- All P1 issues resolved or documented for future sprint
- P2 issues tracked in backlog

---

## üìù Step 7: Document Results

Create an audit report:

```markdown
# UI/UX Audit Report
**Date:** [Date]
**Auditor:** [Name]
**Scope:** [Screens/components audited]

## Summary
- **Total Components Audited:** [N]
- **Average Score:** [X/10]
- **Components Passing (‚â•8.0):** [N]
