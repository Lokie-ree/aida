# Security Agent Addition Summary

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Addition:** New Security Specialist agent with Semgrep MCP integration

---

## Overview

Added a dedicated **Security Agent** to the Pelican AI cursor rules system to address security scanning, FERPA compliance validation, and vulnerability detection using Semgrep MCP.

## Motivation

With active MCP tools including **Semgrep**, a specialized security agent was needed to:
- Leverage Semgrep MCP for automated vulnerability scanning
- Ensure FERPA compliance for Louisiana educator data protection
- Provide security expertise throughout the development lifecycle
- Integrate security reviews into Feature Development and Bug Fix workflows

## What Changed

### New Agent Created

**`cursorrules/security.md`** (385 lines)
- **Role:** Security Specialist focused on Semgrep analysis, FERPA compliance, vulnerability detection
- **Primary MCP Tool:** Semgrep MCP (security scanning, custom rules, pattern matching)
- **Additional MCP Tools:** Convex (security validation), Playwright (security testing), Firecrawl (security research)

### Key Features

#### FERPA Compliance (Priority P0)
- Student and educator data protection validation
- PII detection in logs, URLs, and error messages
- Data access controls and audit logging
- Secure data retention and lifecycle management

#### Application Security
- Authentication security (Better Auth review)
- Session management validation
- API security (Convex function permissions, input validation)
- Email security (Resend integration)
- Client-side security (XSS prevention, React component safety)

#### Infrastructure Security
- Serverless security (Convex backend configuration)
- Environment variables and secrets management
- Third-party integration security (OpenAI, Resend, Vapi)
- Dependency security (vulnerable npm packages)

### Semgrep MCP Integration

#### Security Scans
```bash
# Comprehensive security scan
@semgrep-mcp security_check --code_files '[{"filename":"src/App.tsx","content":"..."}]'

# Custom FERPA compliance rule
@semgrep-mcp semgrep_scan_with_custom_rule --rule "..." --code_files '[...]'

# Local file scanning
@semgrep-mcp semgrep_scan_local --code_files '[{"path":"/absolute/path/to/file.ts"}]'
```

#### Custom Rules Example (FERPA)
```yaml
rules:
  - id: ferpa-pii-in-logs
    pattern: |
      console.log(..., $EMAIL, ...)
    message: "Potential PII (email) in console.log - FERPA violation"
    severity: ERROR
    languages: [javascript, typescript]
```

### Secure Coding Patterns

The agent includes comprehensive secure coding examples:
- Input validation with Convex and Zod
- XSS prevention in React components
- Secure session handling
- FERPA-compliant logging (no PII)
- Authentication and authorization patterns

### Security Vulnerability Categories

- **Authentication & Authorization:** Broken auth, session fixation, weak passwords
- **Data Exposure:** PII in logs, URLs, error messages, email templates
- **Injection Attacks:** SQL/NoSQL injection, command injection, XSS
- **Insecure Dependencies:** npm packages with known CVEs

### Phase 1 MVP Security Checklist

Pre-Launch Audit includes:
- [ ] Semgrep security scan on all TypeScript/React files
- [ ] Better Auth configuration review
- [ ] Convex function permissions validation
- [ ] Email template PII exposure audit
- [ ] Hardcoded secrets check
- [ ] Session management validation
- [ ] Authentication flow testing
- [ ] Input validation on all mutations

## Usage Examples

### Single Agent Mode
```
@cursorrules/security.md
Run a Semgrep security scan on the authentication flow and identify any FERPA compliance issues.
```

### Multi-Agent Mode
```
@cursorrules/security.md @cursorrules/engineer.md
Review the Better Auth integration for security vulnerabilities and implement fixes.
```

### In Feature Development Flow
```
Step 4: @cursorrules/security.md
Review the proposed API design for security implications before implementation.

Step 6: @cursorrules/security.md
Run Semgrep scan on the implemented authentication feature.
```
