# A.I.D.A. MVP Product Requirements Document

## Minimum Lovable Product for Hackathon Success

**Project:** A.I.D.A. (AI-powered Instructional District Assistant)  
**Version:** MVP 1.0 (Hackathon Focused)  
**Date:** September 28, 2025  
**MVP Release:** October 1, 2025  
**Status:** Ready for Development

---

## Executive Summary

A.I.D.A. is a voice-enabled, context-aware AI assistant designed to solve the critical problem of information overload faced by K-12 educators. This MVP focuses on a single, compelling user journey that demonstrates the core value proposition: **a teacher asking a voice-enabled assistant about district-specific policies and receiving intelligent, contextual feedback on their lesson plans**.

The MVP is strategically designed to "go deep, not wide" by focusing on the unique differentiators of hyper-contextualization and voice interface that competitors cannot easily replicate.

---

## Problem Statement

**The Core Problem:** K-12 educators face perpetual information overload, navigating a constant deluge of district policies, curriculum guides, student handbooks, and professional development materials without a centralized, intelligent system to synthesize this information.

**The Pain Point:** Teachers waste valuable time searching through multiple documents and systems to find specific information, leading to burnout and fragmented workflows that detract from meaningful student interaction.

**Market Validation:** The AI in EdTech market is projected to grow from $2.21-5.88 billion (2024) to over $90 billion by 2033, driven by demand for personalized learning and administrative automation.

## Solution Overview

A.I.D.A. is an AI-powered instructional command center that augments human expertise rather than replacing it. The MVP delivers two core capabilities:

1. **Voice-Enabled District Assistant**: Real-time, hands-free interaction with district-specific knowledge
2. **AI-Powered Instructional Feedback**: Intelligent analysis and suggestions for lesson plans

---

## Target Audience

- **Primary Users:** K-12 educators (teachers, curriculum coordinators)
- **Secondary Users:** School district administrators
- **Demo Audience:** Hackathon judges and potential investors

**Key Capabilities:**

- Upload lesson plans or prompts
- AI-generated feedback and suggestions
- Focus on engagement and rigor improvements
- Pedagogically sound recommendations

**User Story:**

> "As an educator, I want to submit my lesson plan to the assistant so it can suggest ways to enhance engagement or add a more rigorous component."

### 3. Teacher Command Center Dashboard

**Purpose:** Centralized overview of key tasks and insights

**Key Capabilities:**

- **Voice Orb Interface:** Dynamic, glowing orb representing A.I.D.A. with state animations
  - Idle: Calm blue glow with gentle pulsing
  - Listening: Purple light with active pulsing
  - Success: Steady green with confirmation pulse
- Quick access to voice assistant
- Lesson plan upload interface
- Recent interactions and feedback
- District context indicators

---

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS (deployed on Vercel)
- **Backend:** Convex (real-time database and serverless functions, deployed on Convex Cloud)
- **AI Engine:** OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (reasoning and generation)
- **Voice Interface:** Vapi (real-time speech-to-text and text-to-speech)
- **Data Ingestion:** Firecrawl (district document scraping and processing)
- **Authentication:** Convex Auth (self-hosted, FERPA-compliant)
- **Design System:** ShadCN + React Bits + TweakCN (voice interface components)

### Data Flow

1. **Ingestion:** Firecrawl scrapes district documents → Clean, structured data
2. **Storage:** Convex RAG builds searchable knowledge base with vector embeddings
3. **Voice Interaction:** Voice input → Vapi → OpenAI → Contextual response (<2s target)
4. **Feedback:** Lesson plan → OpenAI analysis → Structured feedback with engagement suggestions
5. **Audit:** All interactions logged for FERPA compliance

### Performance Requirements

- **Voice Response Time:** <2s for voice queries (critical for demo)
- **Voice Recognition Accuracy:** >90% in quiet environments
- **API Response:** <500ms for standard queries, <2s for RAG operations
- **Mobile Performance:** Lighthouse score >90
- **Uptime:** 99.9% availability target
