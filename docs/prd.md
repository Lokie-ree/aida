# A.I.D.A. MVP Product Requirements Document

## Minimum Lovable Product for Hackathon Success

**Project:** A.I.D.A. (AI-powered Instructional District Assistant)  
**Version:** MVP 1.0 (Hackathon Focused)  
**Date:** September 29, 2025  
**MVP Release:** October 1, 2025  
**Status:** Ready for Development

---

## Executive Summary

A.I.D.A. is the central, trusted source of district information for the entire school community—from parents to administrators to educators—accessible through a hyper-contextualized, voice-first interface. This MVP focuses on a compelling value proposition: **providing instant, accurate answers to district policy questions for all stakeholders through voice interaction**.

The MVP is strategically designed to "go deep, not wide" by focusing on the unique differentiators of hyper-contextualization and voice interface that competitors cannot easily replicate, serving as the single source of truth for district information.

---

## Problem Statement

**The Core Problem:** School communities face a critical communication gap—parents, educators, and administrators struggle to find accurate, up-to-date district information buried in complex websites, PDFs, and multiple systems. This leads to confusion, misinformation, and countless repetitive inquiries.

**The Pain Point:** 
- **Parents:** Navigate confusing district websites trying to find policies on attendance, bus routes, or enrollment
- **Educators:** Waste valuable time searching through multiple documents for district policies and procedures
- **Administrators:** Field repetitive inquiries and struggle to ensure consistent information delivery

**Market Validation:** The AI in EdTech market is projected to grow from $2.21-5.88 billion (2024) to over $90 billion by 2033, driven by demand for improved communication and administrative automation.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS (deployed on Vercel)
- **Backend:** Convex (real-time database and serverless functions, deployed on Convex Cloud)
- **AI Engine:** OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (reasoning and generation)
- **Voice Interface:** Vapi (real-time speech-to-text and text-to-speech)
- **Data Ingestion:** Direct document upload (PDFs, text files) - web scraping removed for simplicity
- **Authentication:** Convex Auth (self-hosted, FERPA-compliant)
- **Design System:** ShadCN

### Data Flow

1. **Ingestion:** District staff upload official documents → Clean, structured data
2. **Storage:** Convex RAG builds searchable knowledge base with vector embeddings
3. **Voice Interaction:** Voice input → Vapi → OpenAI → Contextual response with source citation (<2s target)
4. **Multi-Stakeholder Access:** Parents, educators, and administrators all access the same trusted information
5. **Audit:** All interactions logged for FERPA compliance and analytics

### Performance Requirements

- **Voice Response Time:** <2s for voice queries (critical for demo)
- **Voice Recognition Accuracy:** >90% in quiet environments
- **API Response:** <500ms for standard queries, <2s for RAG operations
- **Mobile Performance:** Lighthouse score >90
- **Uptime:** 99.9% availability target
