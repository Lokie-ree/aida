## üì¢ Core Marketing Principles

To effectively market this project, all efforts must be grounded in these foundational principles:

### Sell the Transformation, Not Features

Our core message must focus on the "new version" of educators that A.I.D.A. helps them become - more confident, efficient, and focused on students. Educators don't buy software; they buy a better teaching experience.

### Target by Awareness Level

Recognize that educators have varying levels of awareness about their information overload problems. Our messaging must be tailored to meet them where they are in their journey.

### Enter the Existing Conversation

Our marketing should not try to invent desire. Instead, it must identify and hook into the existing frustrations about document searching and time management already happening in educators' minds.

### Specificity Sells

Vague claims will be ignored. We must use specific, concrete details, numbers, and tangible outcomes to build credibility. Instead of "faster results," we say, "get district policy answers in under 2 seconds" or "save 2 hours per week on document searching."

## üöÄ Go-to-Market Strategy

## üìÑ Landing Page Strategy

### Define the Avatar

Use the detailed educator personas to ensure all copy speaks directly to their pains, goals, and emotions about information overload and time management.

### Focus on Benefits & Transformation

The headline and body copy must be benefit-driven and story-driven, not a list of features. For example, instead of "Voice Interface," use "Get instant answers to district questions while you're teaching."

### Incorporate Proof & Trust Signals

The page must include elements that build trust and believability. This includes teacher testimonials, FERPA compliance badges, and specific time-saving claims.

### Add Visual Polish

The final design should have a premium feel to act as a "subconscious authority signal" for educators and district administrators.

### Pricing Page Strategy

Clear tiered structure with a "popular choice" positioned to encourage upgrades, showing value for both individual teachers and districts.
