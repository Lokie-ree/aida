      "category": "attendance",
      "question": "What is our district's attendance policy for students?",
      "answer": "Our district requires students to maintain a minimum attendance rate of 95%. Students with more than 9 unexcused absences per semester may be required to attend a student attendance review board meeting. Teachers must mark attendance within the first 10 minutes of each class period. Excused absences include illness, family emergencies, religious observances, and medical appointments with proper documentation.",

      "answer": "Students who arrive more than 10 minutes late to class without a valid excuse will be marked tardy. Three tardies equal one unexcused absence. Teachers should document all tardies in the attendance system. Students with excessive tardies may be referred to administration for intervention strategies including parent conferences and attendance contracts.",

      "answer": "Homework should be meaningful, relevant, and designed to reinforce classroom learning. Elementary students should have no more than 30 minutes of homework per night, middle school students up to 60 minutes, and high school students up to 90 minutes. Teachers must provide clear instructions and due dates. Late work policies should be clearly communicated to students and parents at the beginning of each semester.",

      "question": "How should teachers calculate final grades?",
      "answer": "Final grades should reflect a balanced assessment of student learning including formative assessments (40%), summative assessments (40%), and participation/effort (20%). Teachers must maintain a gradebook with at least one grade entry per week. Grade scales: A (90-100), B (80-89), C (70-79), D (60-69), F (below 60). Progress reports must be sent home every 4.5 weeks.",

      "answer": "Our district follows a progressive discipline approach. Minor infractions result in verbal warnings and documentation. Repeated violations may lead to parent contact, detention, or in-school suspension. Major infractions including violence, drugs, or weapons may result in out-of-school suspension or expulsion. All disciplinary actions must be documented in the student information system within 24 hours.",

      "answer": "Teachers must immediately report any suspected bullying or harassment to administration. All incidents must be documented using the district's incident report form within 24 hours. The school counselor and administration will investigate within 48 hours. Consequences range from mediation and counseling to suspension depending on severity. Parents of all involved students must be notified of the incident and resolution.",

      "answer": "All students with Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) must receive their specified accommodations and modifications. Common accommodations include extended time on tests, preferential seating, use of assistive technology, and modified assignments. Teachers must review each student's IEP at the beginning of the semester and implement accommodations consistently.

      "answer": "Section 504 plans provide accommodations for students with disabilities who don't qualify for special education services but need support to access the general education curriculum. Unlike IEPs, 504 plans don't require specialized instruction. Common 504 accommodations include preferential seating, extended time, use of technology, and modified testing conditions. Teachers must implement all 504 accommodations as specified in the student's plan.",

All device usage is monitored and filtered through the district's network. Inappropriate use may result in device confiscation and disciplinary action. Teachers should establish clear expectations for technology use in their classrooms and monitor student activity regularly.",
