## Section 504 Accommodation Plans

|---------|--------------|
| Requires specialized instruction | No specialized instruction |
| More comprehensive services | Accommodations only |
| Covered under IDEA | Covered under Section 504/ADA |
| Annual goals and progress monitoring | No formal goals required |
| More frequent team meetings | Less formal review process |

### Common 504 Accommodations

- Preferential seating
- Extended time on tests (often 50% extra time)
- Use of technology (word processor, text-to-speech)
