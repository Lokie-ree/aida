## Evaluation Ratings

Teachers receive one of four effectiveness ratings:
- **Ineffective**
- **Effective: Emerging**
- **Effective: Proficient**
- **Highly Effective**

## Observation and Feedback Cycle

### Formal Observation Cycle
1. **Pre-Conference** - Planning discussion before observation
2. **Observation** - Classroom visit with detailed notes
3. **Post-Conference** - Feedback session with specific, actionable guidance

### Conference Frameworks
- **BOY (Beginning of Year)** - Goal setting and planning
- **MOY (Mid-Year)** - Progress monitoring and adjustment
- **EOY (End of Year)** - Final evaluation and reflection

## Student Learning Targets (SLTs)

Teachers must develop and track Student Learning Targets that:
- Align with student needs and curriculum standards
- Include measurable outcomes
- Use valid assessment methods
- Drive instructional decisions
- Demonstrate student growth over time

SLT results are a component of the overall evaluation score.

## Professional Growth Plan (PGP) / Coaching Plan

All teachers must maintain a Professional Growth Plan that includes:
- Self-assessment of practice
- Specific, measurable goals
- Action steps and timelines
- Resources and support needed
- Progress monitoring checkpoints

Teachers rated Ineffective or Effective: Emerging receive intensive coaching support.

## Value-Added Model (VAM)

For teachers in tested grades and subjects:
- **VAM** measures student growth on state assessments
- Compares actual student performance to predicted performance
- Accounts for prior achievement and student characteristics
- Contributes to overall effectiveness rating

**Roster Verification** is required annually to ensure accurate VAM calculations.
