# Git Workflow Guide - Pelican AI

## üö´ **Golden Rule: Never Push Directly to Main**

All changes must go through a feature branch ‚Üí pull request ‚Üí review ‚Üí merge workflow.

---

## üìã Standard Workflow

### 1. **Create Linear Issue (if needed)**

Before starting development, check if a Linear issue exists:

```bash
# Check existing issues
# Visit: https://linear.app/web-agency/team/web-agency/active
# Or search for related issues in Linear
```

**If no issue exists, create one:**
- Use Linear web interface or API
- Follow issue template format
- Set appropriate priority (P0/P1/P2)
- **Assign to appropriate agent** (see Agent Assignment Guide below)
- Link to any related issues

### 1.1. **Agent Assignment Guide**

**Assign issues based on the primary work type:**

**@.cursor/rules/engineer.mdc** - Implementation work:
- Frontend/backend development
- Bug fixes and feature implementation
- Code refactoring and optimization
- Technical debt resolution

**@.cursor/rules/architect.mdc** - System design:
- API design and architecture decisions
- Database schema changes
- Performance optimization
- Technical feasibility analysis

**@.cursor/rules/ux-designer.mdc** - User experience:
- UI/UX design and improvements
- Accessibility compliance
- User flow optimization
- Design system updates

**@.cursor/rules/security.mdc** - Security and compliance:
- Security vulnerability fixes
- FERPA compliance validation
- Security audits and scans
- Data protection measures

**@.cursor/rules/qa.mdc** - Quality assurance:
- Test development and execution
- Bug validation and reproduction
- Quality gates and acceptance criteria
- E2E testing and validation

**@.cursor/rules/wrecking-ball.mdc** - Simplification:
- Code cleanup and removal
- Technical debt elimination
- Documentation consolidation
- Dependency optimization

**@.cursor/rules/pm.mdc** - Product management:
- Feature prioritization
- User story definition
- Business requirements
- Stakeholder coordination

**@.cursor/rules/documentation.mdc** - Documentation:
- Documentation updates
- ADR creation and maintenance
- README and changelog updates
- Knowledge base management

### 2. **Create Feature Branch**

```bash
# Start from updated main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create descriptive feature branch (include Linear issue ID if applicable)
git checkout -b feature/WEB-XX-descriptive-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/WEB-XX-bug-description
# or
git checkout -b docs/WEB-XX-documentation-update
```

**Branch Naming Convention:**
- `feature/WEB-XX-` - New features (e.g., `feature/WEB-18-framework-library-ui`)
- `fix/WEB-XX-` - Bug fixes (e.g., `fix/WEB-15-auth-endpoint-issues`)
- `docs/WEB-XX-` - Documentation updates (e.g., `docs/WEB-46-test-data-management`)
- `refactor/WEB-XX-` - Code refactoring (e.g., `refactor/WEB-16-test-coverage`)
- `test/WEB-XX-` - Test additions/fixes (e.g., `test/WEB-23-e2e-validation`)

### 3. **Make Changes**

```bash
# Make your code changes
# Run tests frequently
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration

# Update Linear issue status to "In Progress" if not already
# Visit: https://linear.app/web-agency/issue/WEB-XX

# Commit with clear messages (include Linear issue ID and agent)
git add .
git commit -m "feat(WEB-XX): add temporary password generation to beta signup (@engineer.mdc)"
```

**Commit Message Convention:**
- `feat(WEB-XX):` - New feature
- `fix(WEB-XX):` - Bug fix
- `docs(WEB-XX):` - Documentation only
- `test(WEB-XX):` - Adding/fixing tests
- `refactor(WEB-XX):` - Code refactoring
- `style(WEB-XX):` - Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- `chore(WEB-XX):` - Updating dependencies, build scripts, etc.

**Agent Coordination:**
- Include agent reference in commit messages: `(@agent.mdc)`
- Tag relevant agents in Linear issue comments for review
- Coordinate with other agents when work overlaps
- Use agent-specific tools and patterns

**Linear Integration:**
- Include Linear issue ID in commit messages
- Update issue status as you progress
- Add comments to Linear issue for major milestones
- Tag relevant agents for review and feedback

### 4. **Push Feature Branch**

```bash
# Push to remote
git push origin feature/WEB-XX-descriptive-name

# If branch doesn't exist yet, set upstream
git push -u origin feature/WEB-XX-descriptive-name
```

### 5. **Update Linear Issue Status**

```bash
# Update Linear issue to "In Review" status
# Visit: https://linear.app/web-agency/issue/WEB-XX
# Add comment with PR link and progress update
```

### 6. **Generate PR Title and Description**

After pushing your feature branch, generate a clear PR title and description:

**PR Title Format:**
- `feat: Add [feature name] (WEB-XX)` (e.g., "feat: Add privacy policy and terms of service modals (WEB-46)")
- `fix: Fix [issue description] (WEB-XX)` (e.g., "fix: Resolve authentication validation error (WEB-15)")
- `docs: Update [documentation] (WEB-XX)` (e.g., "docs: Update API guidelines (WEB-46)")

**PR Description Template:**
```markdown

## ü§ù Agent Collaboration Patterns

### Multi-Agent Workflows

**Feature Development (Engineer + UX Designer + QA):**
1. **UX Designer** creates design specs and user flows
2. **Engineer** implements the feature
3. **QA** validates implementation against acceptance criteria
4. **Security** reviews for vulnerabilities (if needed)

**Bug Fix (QA + Engineer + Security):**
1. **QA** reproduces and documents the bug
2. **Engineer** implements the fix
3. **Security** validates fix doesn't introduce vulnerabilities
4. **QA** validates fix resolves the issue

**Architecture Changes (Architect + Engineer + Security):**
1. **Architect** designs the solution
2. **Engineer** implements the changes
3. **Security** reviews for security implications
4. **QA** tests the implementation

**Documentation Updates (Documentation + PM + Engineer):**
1. **PM** defines requirements
2. **Engineer** provides technical details
3. **Documentation** creates/updates docs
4. **PM** reviews for accuracy

### Agent Handoff Patterns

**When to Hand Off:**
- **Engineer ‚Üí QA:** Feature implementation complete
- **QA ‚Üí Engineer:** Bug reproduction steps documented
- **Architect ‚Üí Engineer:** Technical design approved
- **UX Designer ‚Üí Engineer:** Design specs finalized
- **Any Agent ‚Üí Documentation:** Major changes completed

**Handoff Checklist:**
- [ ] Work is complete and tested
- [ ] Linear issue updated with current status
- [ ] Next agent tagged in Linear issue
- [ ] Handoff notes added to issue comments
- [ ] Any blockers or dependencies documented
