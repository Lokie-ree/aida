## Executive Summary

This comprehensive research report validates the critical need for the AI for LA Educators initiative and provides evidence-based insights into Louisiana's educator AI education landscape. Our research reveals that while Louisiana has released official AI guidance, there exists a significant gap between state policy (focused on student AI use) and educator needs (focused on productivity and professional development).

**Key Findings:**
- **60% of Louisiana teachers** used AI tools last school year, but most lack practical training
- **"Record number of academic integrity issues"** driven by AI confusion among educators
- **Jefferson Parish School District** has 140 teacher vacancies and 3,000 children without teachers daily
- **Louisiana educators need platform-agnostic guidance** - they use multiple AI tools simultaneously
- **State guidance focuses on student policies** while educators need productivity support

## Louisiana's Current AI Landscape

### State AI Policy Status

#### **Louisiana's Official AI Guidance (August 2024)**
Louisiana released comprehensive "Artificial Intelligence in Louisiana Schools: Guidance for K-12 Schools" with:

**Key Components:**
- **Four-component cyclical approach**: Purpose & Research, Policy & Guidance, Engage Stakeholders, Evaluation & Monitoring
- **Four-tier AI integration system**: AI-Empowered, AI-Enhanced, AI-Assisted, AI-Prohibited (aligned with SAMR model)
- **C.R.E.A.T.E. Framework** for effective AI prompting (Character, Request, Examples, Additions, Type, Extras)
- **Strategic AI Integration Pre-Work Checklist** for educators
- **Comprehensive safeguards** at both system and classroom levels

**Critical Gap Identified:** The state guidance is **student-focused** and **policy-heavy**, emphasizing data privacy, legal compliance, and preventing academic dishonesty. It lacks practical guidance for **educator productivity** and **professional development**.

### Current AI Tool Adoption in Louisiana

#### **Active AI Platforms in Louisiana Schools**
Based on research findings, Louisiana schools are actively using:

1. **Zearn** - 272,000+ active students (Math learning platform)
2. **Amira Learning** - 57,000+ active students (AI-powered reading tutor with 72% improvement in reading ability)
3. **Khanmigo** - 50% student activation rate (AI learning assistant, pilot launched January 2025)

#### **Teacher AI Usage Statistics**
- **60% of teachers** used AI tools last school year (NOLA.com)
- **"Record number of academic integrity issues"** driven by AI (Benjamin Franklin High School)
- **Teachers are skeptical** and view AI primarily as a "high-tech cheating tool"
- **Less than a third of schools** have written AI policies

---

## Critical Research Gaps Identified

### **Priority 1: Educator AI Literacy Crisis** ⚠️ **CRITICAL GAP**

**Gap:** Most Louisiana educators have no practical AI knowledge beyond "ChatGPT as Google search"

**Evidence:**
- Teachers view AI as "high-tech cheating tool" rather than productivity partner
- Lack of systematic AI training programs for educators
- "Most leaders don't really understand it themselves" making it difficult to facilitate training

**Impact:** Our platform fills a massive void in educator AI education

### **Priority 2: Practical AI Implementation** ⚠️ **CRITICAL GAP**

**Gap:** No guidance on how educators can actually use AI tools effectively

**Evidence:**
- State focuses on student policies, not educator professional development
- Teachers need hands-on training with ethical, classroom-focused tools
- Emphasis needed on AI literacy and responsible use

**Impact:** Our platform provides the missing practical guidance educators desperately need

### **Priority 3: District-Level AI Education** ⚠️ **CRITICAL GAP**

**Gap:** School districts lack basic AI understanding and systematic training

**Evidence:**
- Jefferson Parish School District (largest in Louisiana) has 140 teacher vacancies
- 3,000 children without teachers on any given day
- Districts are "making up rules as they go" due to lack of clear guidance

**Impact:** Our platform can serve as the foundational AI education for Louisiana educators
