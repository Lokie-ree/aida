# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for AI for LA Educators.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences.

**Format:** Each ADR follows a consistent structure:
- **Context:** What is the issue we're addressing?
- **Decision:** What did we decide?
- **Rationale:** Why did we decide this?
- **Alternatives:** What other options did we consider?
- **Consequences:** What are the results of this decision?
