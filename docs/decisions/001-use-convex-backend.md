# ADR 001: Use Convex for Backend

**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Accepted  
**Deciders:** System Architect, Product Manager

---

## Context

We need a backend infrastructure that supports:
- Real-time data synchronization
- Serverless architecture (no server management)
- TypeScript-first development
- Built-in authentication
- Scalability for beta and beyond

The existing A.I.D.A. codebase already uses Convex, which has proven reliable.

---

## Decision

Continue using **Convex** as the backend platform for AI for LA Educators.

---

## Rationale

### Advantages
- ✅ **Already Integrated:** A.I.D.A. codebase uses Convex successfully
- ✅ **Real-Time:** Automatic real-time updates for collaborative features
- ✅ **TypeScript Native:** End-to-end type safety
- ✅ **Serverless:** No infrastructure management required
- ✅ **Built-in Auth:** Convex Auth with Better Auth integration
- ✅ **Developer Experience:** Excellent DX with hot reloading
- ✅ **Cost-Effective:** Free tier sufficient for beta program

### Disadvantages
- ⚠️ **Vendor Lock-in:** Tied to Convex platform
- ⚠️ **Learning Curve:** Team must learn Convex patterns
- ⚠️ **Limited Ecosystem:** Smaller community vs. traditional backends

---

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Firebase
- **Pros:** Large ecosystem, Google-backed
- **Cons:** Less TypeScript-friendly, more complex pricing
- **Why Not:** A.I.D.A. already on Convex, migration cost high

### 2. Supabase
- **Pros:** PostgreSQL-based, open source
- **Cons:** More infrastructure to manage, less real-time
- **Why Not:** Would require complete rewrite of A.I.D.A.

### 3. Custom Node.js + PostgreSQL
- **Pros:** Full control, no vendor lock-in
- **Cons:** Significant infrastructure overhead, slower development
- **Why Not:** Overkill for beta, slower time to market

---

## Consequences

### Positive
- Faster development (reuse A.I.D.A. infrastructure)
- Real-time updates for community features
- Simplified deployment and scaling
- Strong TypeScript integration

### Negative
- Vendor lock-in to Convex
- Team must maintain Convex expertise
- Migration to another platform would be costly

### Neutral
- Need to monitor Convex pricing as we scale
- Should maintain data export capabilities

---

## Implementation Notes

- Extend existing Convex schema with new tables
- Reuse authentication and user management
- Add new modules for frameworks, testimonials, innovations
- Maintain backward compatibility with A.I.D.A. features

---

## Review Date

**Next Review:** After beta launch (3 months)  
**Criteria for Review:** Cost, performance, developer satisfaction
