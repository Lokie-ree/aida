# Agent Rules Migration to .mdc Format

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Migration:** cursorrules/*.md → .cursor/rules/*.mdc (Official Cursor Format)

---

## Overview

Successfully migrated all 7 Pelican AI agent rules to the official Cursor `.mdc` format in `.cursor/rules/` directory, following the established pattern of `convex_rules.mdc`.

## Why .mdc Format?

### Benefits
1. **Official Cursor Format** - `.mdc` (Markdown Cursor) is the recognized format
2. **Better Organization** - `.cursor/` directory keeps all Cursor-specific files together
3. **Consistent with Existing** - Matches `convex_rules.mdc` already in project
4. **Auto-Discovery** - Cursor automatically discovers rules in `.cursor/rules/`
5. **Cleaner Root** - No `cursorrules/` directory cluttering project root
6. **Frontmatter Support** - `.mdc` files support description and glob patterns

### .mdc Frontmatter Structure
```yaml
---
description: Brief description of the agent role and focus
globs: **/*.ts,**/*.tsx,**/*.js  # File patterns this rule applies to
---
```

```yaml
---
description: Product Manager agent for Pelican AI - business strategy, user stories, and Louisiana educator empowerment
globs: **/*.md,**/*.json,flow/**/*
---
```

## Agent Content Preserved

All agent content from the original `.md` files has been preserved in the `.mdc` format, including:

✅ Role Identity  
✅ Core Responsibilities  
✅ MCP Tool Configuration (Semgrep, Convex, Playwright, Firecrawl, Context7, Linear)  
✅ Quality Standards  
✅ Communication Style  
✅ References  
✅ Code examples and patterns  
✅ Security checklists (Security agent)  
✅ Phase 1 MVP focus  

## Advantages of .mdc Format

### 1. Official Support
- Recognized by Cursor as official rule format
- Better integration with Cursor AI features
- Future-proof for Cursor updates

### 2. Better Organization
- All Cursor-specific files in `.cursor/` directory
- Cleaner project root structure
- Follows established pattern (convex_rules.mdc already exists)

### 3. Enhanced Functionality
- Frontmatter metadata (description, globs)
- File pattern matching for context relevance
- Automatic rule discovery by Cursor

### 4. Improved Maintainability
- Single location for all Cursor rules
- Easier to manage and update
- Consistent with Cursor documentation
