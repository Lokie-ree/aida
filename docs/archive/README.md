## Archive Guidelines

### What Gets Archived
- **Completed Milestones:** Documentation of finished phases or major achievements
- **Historical Reports:** Analysis documents that were time-specific
- **Superseded Plans:** Planning documents that have been replaced by newer versions
- **Old Decision Records:** ADRs that have been superseded or are no longer relevant

### What Stays Active
- **Current ADRs:** Recent architectural decisions still relevant to current development
- **Core Documentation:** ARCHITECTURE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, README.md
- **Reference Documentation:** Brand guidelines, product requirements, data recovery guides
- **Operational Documentation:** Current testing protocols, deployment guides

### Archive Maintenance
- **Read-Only:** Archived documents should not be modified
- **Reference Only:** Use for historical context, not current guidance
- **Periodic Review:** Consider purging very old archives annually
- **Clear Dating:** All archived documents should have clear dates
