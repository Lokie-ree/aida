# Agent-Based Development System Migration

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Final Format:** `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` (Official Cursor Format)

---

## Overview

Successfully migrated Pelican AI's agent-based development system from JSON configuration files to the official Cursor `.mdc` format, consolidating documentation and establishing a clean, maintainable agent system.

## Migration Journey

### Phase 1: JSON to Markdown (October 12, 2025)
- **Source:** `flow/agent-specs.json` + `orchestrator.json`
- **Target:** `cursorrules/*.md` format
- **Outcome:** 7 agent rule files created (1,606 lines)
- **Added:** Wrecking Ball Specialist agent (new role)

### Phase 2: Markdown to .mdc (October 12, 2025)
- **Source:** `cursorrules/*.md` files
- **Target:** `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` (Official Cursor format)
- **Outcome:** 8 agent files in proper Cursor directory
- **Benefits:** 
  - Official Cursor format with frontmatter support
  - Better organization (all Cursor files in `.cursor/` directory)
  - Auto-discovery by Cursor IDE
  - File pattern matching via globs

### Phase 3: Documentation Consolidation (October 13, 2025)
- **Deleted:** `orchestrator.json` (396 lines) - superseded by agent system
- **Deleted:** `README.md`, `product-requirements.md` - consolidated into agent docs
- **Updated:** ADRs to reflect Phase 1 MVP focus (email-first approach)
- **Result:** Cleaner project with single source of truth

Design and implement the weekly email cron job using Convex.
```

### Specialized Tasks
```
@.cursor/rules/wrecking-ball.mdc
Audit and remove unused dependencies from package.json.

@.cursor/rules/security.mdc

## Benefits of .mdc Format

### 1. Official Support
- Recognized by Cursor as official rule format
- Better integration with Cursor AI features
- Future-proof for Cursor updates

### 2. Better Organization
- All Cursor-specific files in `.cursor/` directory
- Cleaner project root structure
- Follows established pattern (convex_rules.mdc)

### 3. Enhanced Functionality
- Frontmatter metadata (description, globs)
- File pattern matching for context relevance
- Automatic rule discovery by Cursor

### 4. Improved Maintainability
- Single location for all Cursor rules
- Easier to manage and update
- Consistent with Cursor documentation

---

## Frontmatter Structure

All `.mdc` files include frontmatter:

```yaml
---
description: Brief description of the agent role and focus
globs: **/*.ts,**/*.tsx,**/*.js  # File patterns this rule applies to
---
```

**Example:**
```yaml
---
description: Product Manager agent for Pelican AI - business strategy, user stories, and Louisiana educator empowerment
globs: **/*.md,**/*.json,flow/**/*
---
```
