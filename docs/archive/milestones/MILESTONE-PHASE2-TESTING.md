# Milestone: Phase 2 UI Testing and CORS Fix ‚úÖ

**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
**Impact:** Critical infrastructure fixes and comprehensive Phase 2 feature validation

---

## üéØ Milestone Summary

Successfully completed comprehensive QA testing of Phase 2 UI exposure features, identified and fixed critical CORS issues with Better Auth integration, and documented all findings with detailed bug reports in Linear. This milestone validates that Phase 2 backend features are ready for UI exposure, with 3 critical bugs identified that must be fixed before launch.

## üîß Technical Details
