# Future Frameworks (Archived)

These frameworks were created before finalizing the beta cohort strategy. They have been simplified from their original district-specific versions and archived for future use with district partnerships.

---

## Why These Are Archived

**Created:** October 12, 2025  
**Status:** Archived pending Phase 2 deployment

**Context:**
These three frameworks were initially developed assuming district partnerships with structured systems (pacing guides, assessment platforms, collaborative meeting protocols). Upon identifying the actual beta cohort—8 educators (6 math/STEM teachers + 2 master teachers)—we determined a single-framework approach would be more appropriate for Phase 1.

**Strategic Decision:**
Rather than overwhelming beta testers with 4 frameworks in 4 weeks, we're focusing on ONE foundation framework (AIB-001: Lesson Objective Unpacker) and co-creating additional frameworks based on their actual identified pain points.

## Frameworks in This Directory

### AIB-002: Curriculum Pacing Assistant
**Original Version:** Tier I Curriculum Fidelity Check  
**Simplified For:** Universal curriculum pacing support  
**Target Audience:** Teachers with any structured curriculum and pacing expectations  
**Key Change:** Removed district-specific terminology ("Tier I", "2nd 9 Weeks", "pacing chart")

**Future Use:**
- District presentations demonstrating curriculum implementation support
- Post-beta deployment for teachers with structured pacing requirements
- Can be customized for specific district curriculum systems

---

### AIB-003: Assessment Data Analyzer
**Original Version:** OnCourse CDA Data Summarizer  
**Simplified For:** Universal assessment data analysis  
**Target Audience:** Teachers analyzing any assessment platform data  
**Key Change:** Removed platform-specific references ("OnCourse", "CDA")

**Future Use:**
- District presentations demonstrating data analysis support
- Post-beta deployment for teachers conducting assessment analysis
- Can be adapted for specific assessment platforms (OnCourse, Illuminate, etc.)

---

### AIB-004: Collaborative Planning Facilitator
**Original Version:** Internalization Alignment Scrutiny  
**Simplified For:** Universal collaborative planning meetings  
**Target Audience:** Teachers engaged in any collaborative planning  
**Key Change:** Removed district-specific terminology ("cluster meetings", "internalization guide", "Tier I")

**Future Use:**
- District presentations demonstrating collaborative planning support
- Post-beta deployment for teams with structured planning time
- Can be customized for specific meeting protocols (PLCs, data teams, lesson study, etc.)

---

## Why They're Valuable

These frameworks address real educator pain points:

1. **AIB-002:** Pacing pressures and material preparation challenges
2. **AIB-003:** Data analysis paralysis consuming re-teaching time
3. **AIB-004:** Unproductive collaborative meetings lacking concrete outcomes

The core prompts and structures are sound. They simply need to be deployed at the right time with the right audience.

## Connection to Beta Program

**Phase 1 (Current):** 
- Focus: AIB-001 (Lesson Objective Unpacker) only
- Strategy: Master one foundation skill, gather feedback, identify actual needs
- Beta Cohort: 8 educators (math/STEM focus)

**Phase 2 (Future):**
- Deploy these frameworks IF beta tester pain points align with their focus areas
- Customize based on actual district systems beta testers use
- May inform NEW frameworks co-created with beta testers

**Documented Beta Tester Pain Points:**
1. Lesson plan internalization & differentiation (copy/paste from curriculum providers)
2. Data analysis for collaborative meetings (teachers need talking points, master teachers need facilitation structure)
3. Tedious task automation (repetitive administrative work)

**Alignment Analysis:**
- AIB-002: Partially aligns with Pain Point #1 (curriculum work)
- AIB-003: Directly aligns with Pain Point #2 (data analysis)
- AIB-004: Directly aligns with Pain Point #2 (collaborative meetings)

These frameworks may inform Phase 2 development, but will be refined based on actual beta feedback.

## For District Presentations

These simplified frameworks are presentation-ready for:

**Scenario 1: District Partnership Pitches**
- "Here's how we support curriculum implementation..."
- "Here's how we streamline assessment data analysis..."
- "Here's how we make collaborative planning more productive..."

**Scenario 2: Post-Beta Scaling**
- After successful beta, showcase additional frameworks available
- Demonstrate platform-agnostic approach across different educator workflows
- Position as "coming soon" features based on initial beta success

**Scenario 3: Customization Examples**
- "We can adapt these frameworks to YOUR district's specific systems"
- Show how we've already thought through common pain points
- Demonstrate responsiveness to district needs

---

## Original Versions

The original, district-specific versions of these frameworks (with Tier I, OnCourse, cluster meetings terminology) are archived in the parent `archive/` directory for reference. Those versions were too specific for the Phase 1 beta but may be useful for future district partnerships with those exact systems.

---

## Next Steps

**If deploying these frameworks:**
1. Review current beta tester feedback
2. Confirm pain points align with framework focus
3. Test with 2-3 beta testers who specifically request this support
4. Gather feedback and refine
5. Add to post-framework survey options
6. Deploy to wider audience if successful

**If creating NEW frameworks instead:**
1. Use these as structural templates
2. Apply the same quality standards (prompts, examples, ethical guidelines)
3. Align to actual documented pain points
4. Test with beta cohort before wider release
