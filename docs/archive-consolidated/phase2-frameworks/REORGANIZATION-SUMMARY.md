# Beta Content Folder Reorganization

**Date:** October 12, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## What Was Done

Cleaned up the `docs/beta-content/` folder from **15 files** (with duplicates and inconsistencies) down to **9 active files** (plus archive).

---

## Before vs. After

### Before (15 files - confusing!)
```
❌ 3 different summary files with overlapping info
❌ Old files referencing parent communication (obsolete AIB-001)
❌ Duplicate/inconsistent information across files
❌ No clear entry point
❌ Hard to know which files to use
```

### After (9 active files - clean!)
```
✅ Single source of truth: README.md
✅ All files reference correct AIB-001 (Lesson Objective Unpacker)
✅ Obsolete files archived (not deleted, for reference)
✅ Clear Quick Start section in README
✅ File organization summary at end of README
```

---

## Files Moved to Archive

**Why archive instead of delete?**  
These files contain valuable content and history, but are superseded by current versions or will be used in Phase 2.

### Moved to `archive/` folder:
1. **AIB-001-parent-communication-framework.md** - Deferred to Phase 2 (still valuable, just not Week 1)
2. **ipsb-pain-points.md** - Source research material for district-specific frameworks
3. **COMPLETION-SUMMARY.md** - Referenced old AIB-001, superseded by README.md
4. **IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md** - Referenced old AIB-001, superseded by README.md
5. **FRAMEWORK-CREATION-SUMMARY.md** - Outdated, info now in README.md
6. **UPDATE_EMAIL_TEMPLATE.md** - Email instructions now in README.md

All archived files documented in `archive/README.md`

---

## Active Files (What to Use)

### Framework Content (4 files)
1. **AIB-001-lesson-objective-unpacker.md** - Week 1 foundation framework
2. **AIB-002-curriculum-fidelity-check.md** - Week 2 district framework
3. **AIB-003-oncourse-cda-data-summarizer.md** - Week 3 district framework
4. **AIB-004-internalization-alignment-scrutiny.md** - Week 4 district framework

### Implementation Guides (2 files)
5. **README.md** - Master implementation guide (START HERE!)
6. **FRAMEWORK-STRATEGY-UPDATE.md** - Strategy documentation

### Beta Experience Content (3 files)
7. **beta-welcome-kit.md** - Beta tester onboarding document
8. **post-framework-survey.md** - Feedback form setup
9. **weekly-check-in-survey.md** - Weekly check-in form setup

---

---

## No Duplicate or Inconsistent Information

**Verified clean:**
- ✅ All files reference AIB-001 as "Lesson Objective Unpacker"
- ✅ No files reference "Parent Communication Framework" as Week 1
- ✅ No conflicting time savings estimates
- ✅ No duplicate "summary" or "implementation" guides
- ✅ Single source of truth (README.md) for all implementation guidance

---

## Quick Navigation

### For Implementation
**Start here:** `README.md` - Complete guide with Quick Start

### For Understanding Strategy
**Read this:** `FRAMEWORK-STRATEGY-UPDATE.md` - Why we chose this approach

### For Creating Beta Experience
1. Read `README.md` Quick Start section
2. Create frameworks from `AIB-001-*.md` through `AIB-004-*.md`
3. Create onboarding from `beta-welcome-kit.md`
4. Create forms from `post-framework-survey.md` and `weekly-check-in-survey.md`

### For Reference/History
**Check archive:** `archive/README.md` lists what's there and why

---

## File Count Summary

**Before:** 15 files (confusing, duplicates)  
**After:** 9 active files + 1 archive folder (clean, clear)

**Reduction:** 40% fewer files, 100% clearer structure

---

## Benefits

1. **Clear Entry Point:** README.md Quick Start tells you exactly where to begin
2. **No Confusion:** Only one framework per week, clearly numbered
3. **No Duplicates:** Single source of truth for implementation
4. **Easy Reference:** Archive folder keeps history without cluttering active work
5. **Consistent Naming:** All files use correct framework names
6. **Better Organization:** Files grouped by purpose (frameworks, guides, surveys)

---

## What You Should Do

### If You're Implementing the Beta Launch:
1. Start with `README.md` Quick Start section
2. Follow the Implementation Sequence
3. Ignore everything in `archive/` folder (unless you need history)

### If You Need the Parent Communication Framework:
- It's in `archive/AIB-001-parent-communication-framework.md`
- Will be deployed in Phase 2 (not Week 1)
- See `FRAMEWORK-STRATEGY-UPDATE.md` for why

### If You Need Source Research:
- See `archive/ipsb-pain-points.md` for Iberville Parish research
- See `archive/README.md` for what else is archived

---

## Next Steps

✅ **Reorganization complete** - No action needed  
✅ **All files consistent** - Ready to use  
✅ **Archive documented** - Nothing lost  

**You can now proceed with implementation using the clean, organized structure!**
