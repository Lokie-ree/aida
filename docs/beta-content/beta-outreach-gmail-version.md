**Subject:** You've shaped how I see education—now let's shape how Louisiana uses AI

---

[Name],

I'm reaching out personally (not as part of any district initiative) because you've made an impact on how I see this profession. Whether it was [specific memory/lesson], you helped me understand what it truly means to put students first.

That's why I'm asking for your help now.

**We can't afford to wait for the state.** Louisiana is light years behind on AI guidance. While districts scramble and teachers navigate alone, frontline educators like you need practical support right now—not in two years when policy catches up.

I've built **Pelican AI** to solve this problem. It's not another AI tool to learn. It's platform-agnostic guidance that works with ANY AI tool you already have—MagicSchool AI, Gemini, ChatGPT, Brisk, whatever. Built specifically for Louisiana educators, aligned to our standards, with ethical guardrails baked in.

**Here's where you come in:** I need 20 educators who understand what's at stake to be founding beta testers. Not to passively test software—to actively shape how AI integration happens in Louisiana classrooms. Your feedback will directly determine what we build next.

**As a founding member, you'll get exclusive platform access with lifetime benefits—priority support, founder pricing, and recognition that no one else will ever have access to. This is a one-time opportunity to be part of the foundation.**

**WHAT I'M ASKING**

**Time commitment:** ~1 hour per week for 8-12 weeks

• Try practical AI frameworks that save 3-5 hours/week on planning and prep
• Share honest feedback through quick surveys (5-10 min each)
• Optional: Join office hours via Google Meet when you can
• Help us build what Louisiana educators actually need

**How we'll collaborate:**
I'll set up a **private Google Space** for our beta cohort where we can:
• Access all frameworks and resources
• Share feedback asynchronously
• Ask questions and support each other
• Schedule Meet sessions for real-time collaboration

Since we're all in the same workspace, this makes coordination seamless.

**WHAT YOU GET AS A FOUNDING MEMBER**

✓ **Lifetime Founder Access** — Core platform features free forever, even after we launch paid plans

✓ **Founder Pricing Lock** — If we add premium features later, you get 50% off for life (locked in at today's prices)

✓ **Priority Support** — Dedicated response channel for founding members only

✓ **Early Access Pass** — Every new framework and feature before public release (30-60 day head start)

✓ **Founding Member Recognition** — Your name on our website as someone who led the way

✓ **Product Roadmap Voice** — Quarterly input sessions where your feedback shapes what we build next

✓ **Exclusive Founder Events** — Members-only webinars, workshops, and community gatherings

---

**IMPORTANT CONTEXT**

• **This is independent of district admin** — your feedback is confidential
• **Participation is entirely voluntary** — no obligation whatsoever
• **This is about educator leadership** — we're doing the hard work while others debate policy
• **You can opt out anytime** — no questions asked

---

**NEXT STEPS (IF YOU'RE IN)**

**Just reply "Yes" to this email** and I'll:
1. Send you exclusive platform access credentials (founder member status)
2. Add you to our private Google Space (launching next week)
3. Send you the beta welcome kit with first framework
4. Share the full timeline and expectations document

**If you have questions first**, reply with them or reach me at [personal phone/email] if you'd prefer to discuss privately.

---

This isn't about technology. It's about reclaiming your time and your agency as an educator. **We're the ones on the frontline—we get to decide how AI fits into our classrooms.**

You've already taught me so much about this calling. This is a chance for us to lead together.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - Even if you can't commit to the full program, I'd love to hear your thoughts. Your perspective always matters.
