## ðŸš¨ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Google Doc requires sign-in to view
**Solution:** Make sure sharing is set to "Anyone with link can view", not "Anyone with link can edit" or "Restricted"

### Issue: Framework prompt doesn't work well in a specific AI platform
**Solution:** Document platform-specific issues in Tips & Variations section. The prompt is designed to be universal, but you may need minor adjustments.

### Issue: Email links don't work
**Solution:** Use the shareable link format from Google Docs, not the editing URL. Shareable links look like: `https://docs.google.com/document/d/[DOC-ID]/edit`

### Issue: Form conditional logic not working
**Solution:** In Google Forms, click the three dots on the question â†’ "Go to section based on answer" â†’ Set up routing

### Issue: Beta testers not engaging with frameworks
**Solution:** Send personal follow-up email after 3 days. Ask if they have questions or need help getting started.
