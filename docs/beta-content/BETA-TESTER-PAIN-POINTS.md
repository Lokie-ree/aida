# Beta Tester Pain Points

**Cohort:** 8 Educators (6 math/STEM teachers + 2 master teachers)  
**Documented:** October 12, 2025  
**Purpose:** Guide future framework development based on actual beta tester needs

---

## Overview

These pain points were identified through direct conversations with the 8-person beta cohort before launch. They represent real, documented challenges these educators face daily. Future frameworks should be co-created with beta testers to address these needs.

## Pain Point #1: Lesson Plan Internalization & Differentiation

### Context
**Who:** 6 math/STEM teachers  
**Environment:** Teachers working with curriculum from approved providers

### The Challenge

Teachers are spending excessive time **copy/pasting information** from curriculum provider resources into their lesson plans instead of actually **collaborating with peers** on instructional improvements.

**Specific Pain Points:**
- Curriculum providers give standardized lesson plans that need adaptation for local context
- Teachers need to differentiate for their unique student needs
- Must stay within approved curriculum boundaries (can't stray too far)
- Copy/paste work feels manual and tedious rather than thoughtful planning

### What Teachers Want

**Primary Need:** Help internalizing and adapting standardized lesson plans efficiently

**Bonus Opportunity:** Map math/STEM topics to student interests to increase engagement

**Example:**
"I have a lesson plan for teaching algebraic expressions from the curriculum guide. I know my students—they love basketball and video games. I spend 45 minutes trying to create word problems that connect to their interests while still covering the required standards. Can AI help me do this in 10 minutes?"

### Potential Framework Direction

A framework that helps teachers:
1. Quickly analyze curriculum-provided lessons for key components
2. Identify differentiation opportunities that stay within curriculum bounds
3. Generate student interest connections for math/STEM topics
4. Streamline the "internalization" process from 45+ minutes to under 10 minutes

**Note:** This is NOT about replacing curriculum—it's about efficient adaptation and differentiation within approved materials.

## Pain Point #2: Data Analysis for Cluster Meetings

### Context
**Who:** 6 teachers + 2 master teachers  
**Environment:** Weekly collaborative meetings to discuss student data and plan instruction

### The Challenge

**For Teachers:**
Teachers receive assessment data but struggle to turn it into **meaningful talking points** for collaborative discussions. They know their students struggled, but articulating *why* and *what to do about it* takes 30+ minutes of prep time they don't have.

**For Master Teachers:**
Master teachers facilitate these collaborative meetings but need **structures to keep discussions focused and productive**. Without a framework, meetings drift off-topic or stay surface-level, wasting valuable collaboration time.

**Specific Pain Points:**
- Data comes in raw numbers (percentages, item analysis) but needs to be synthesized into actionable insights
- Teachers feel unprepared to contribute meaningfully to data discussions
- Master teachers struggle to facilitate deep, focused conversations
- Meetings often end without concrete action steps

### What Teachers & Master Teachers Want

**Teachers Need:** A way to prepare data insights in under 10 minutes before meetings

**Master Teachers Need:** Facilitation tools to keep meetings rigorous and action-oriented

**Example Scenarios:**

*Teacher perspective:*
"I have assessment data showing 60% of students missed problems involving fractions. I know I need to bring this to our meeting tomorrow, but I'm not sure what the misconception is or what to suggest we do about it. I spend 30 minutes staring at the data trying to figure out what to say."

*Master teacher perspective:*
"I'm facilitating a data meeting tomorrow. I have the assessment results, but I know if I just show the data, we'll spend 20 minutes complaining about student performance instead of making a re-teach plan. I need guiding questions that keep us focused on solutions."

### Potential Framework Direction

**Two related frameworks:**

1. **For Teachers:** Data Prep for Collaborative Discussions
   - Input: Raw assessment data
   - Output: 2-3 talking points identifying patterns and suggesting next steps
   - Time: Under 10 minutes

2. **For Master Teachers:** Collaborative Meeting Facilitator
   - Input: Meeting agenda and data to discuss
   - Output: 3-5 probing questions that keep discussion focused and result in concrete action steps
   - Time: Under 10 minutes prep, meeting stays on track

**Note:** These frameworks would work together—teachers prep insights, master teachers facilitate the discussion using structured questions.

## Pain Point #3: Tedious Task Automation

### Context
**Who:** All 8 beta testers  
**Environment:** Daily teaching workload with repetitive administrative tasks

### The Challenge

Teachers are spending significant time on **repetitive tasks that feel automated** but currently require manual effort. These tasks consume 30-60 minutes daily that could be spent on high-impact instructional work.

**Specific Pain Points:**
- Creating variations of the same type of problem/question
- Formatting and organizing materials
- Writing similar feedback comments repeatedly
- Generating parent communication for routine updates
- Creating practice sets that mirror assessment formats

### What Teachers Want

**Primary Need:** Identify and automate the highest-impact tedious tasks

**Key Question:** "What's the thing you do every week that makes you think 'This should be automated'?"

**Example Scenarios:**

*Math teacher:*
"I create 5 practice problems for homework every night. They need to mirror what we learned but use different numbers/contexts. It takes 15-20 minutes of changing numbers and retyping. I wish I could just say what type of problem and get 10 variations instantly."

*Master teacher:*
"I send weekly progress updates to parents. The format is always the same: what we learned, how their child did, what to practice. I'm essentially writing the same email structure 25 times with different student-specific details. It takes an hour every Friday."

*STEM teacher:*
"I need to create different versions of the same lab handout for different class periods. Same content, slight variations to prevent copying. Takes 30 minutes per class period."

### Potential Framework Direction

**Strategy:** Don't create ONE tedious task framework. Instead:

1. **Use weekly check-in survey question #5** to identify specific tedious tasks
2. **Track patterns** across all beta testers
3. **Prioritize** the 2-3 most common tedious tasks
4. **Build mini-frameworks** targeting those specific tasks

**Example Mini-Frameworks:**
- Problem Set Generator (for math teachers)
- Progress Update Composer (for parent communication)
- Lab/Handout Variation Creator (for STEM teachers)

**Note:** This pain point is intentionally broad. The goal is to let beta testers tell us which tedious tasks matter most through their weekly feedback.

## Framework Co-Creation Strategy

### Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4)
- **Focus:** Master AIB-001 (Lesson Objective Unpacker)
- **Goal:** Build confidence with AI-assisted planning
- **Data Collection:** Gather pain point feedback through weekly surveys

### Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8)
- **Review:** Analyze pain point patterns from weekly survey question #5
- **Prioritize:** Identify which pain points align with most beta testers
- **Prototype:** Create 1-2 frameworks addressing highest-priority pain points
- **Test:** With 2-3 beta testers before wider deployment

### Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12)
- **Refine:** Based on Phase 2 feedback
- **Scale:** Deploy refined frameworks to all beta testers
- **Iterate:** Continue gathering feedback and improving

### Decision Framework

**When deciding which frameworks to build:**

1. **Frequency:** How often do beta testers encounter this pain point?
2. **Impact:** How much time would solving it save?
3. **Alignment:** Does it fit with "academic rigor and planning" value proposition?
4. **Feasibility:** Can we create an effective AI prompt for this in 2 weeks?

**Example Decision:**
- Pain Point #2 (Data Analysis): High frequency (weekly), High impact (30+ min saved), Strong alignment, Feasible → BUILD
- Random request for "email signature generator": Low frequency, Low impact, Poor alignment → DON'T BUILD

## Connection to Archived Frameworks

### Alignment Analysis

**AIB-002 (Curriculum Pacing Assistant):**
- Partial match to Pain Point #1 (curriculum work)
- May inform framework development but needs customization for copy/paste internalization challenge

**AIB-003 (Assessment Data Analyzer):**
- Direct match to Pain Point #2 (data analysis for teachers)
- Strong candidate for Phase 2 deployment with minor adaptations

**AIB-004 (Collaborative Planning Facilitator):**
- Direct match to Pain Point #2 (facilitation for master teachers)
- Strong candidate for Phase 2 deployment with minor adaptations

**Conclusion:** 
The archived frameworks (especially AIB-003 and AIB-004) may be exactly what beta testers need for Pain Point #2. However, we should:
1. Wait for beta testers to confirm this pain point through weekly surveys
2. Test with 2-3 beta testers before full deployment
3. Refine based on their specific data systems and meeting structures
