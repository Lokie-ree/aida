# Beta Welcome Kit

**Welcome to the Pelican AI Beta Program!**

Thank you for joining us as a founding member. This guide will help you get the most value from your beta experience.

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### What is Pelican AI?

Pelican AI is a platform-agnostic AI guidance system designed specifically for Louisiana educators. We teach you how to use ANY AI tool you already have access to‚ÄîMagicSchool AI, Brisk, SchoolAI, Gemini, ChatGPT, or others‚Äîwith confidence and ethical guidelines.

We're not another software platform. We're your guide to using AI effectively while maintaining Louisiana standards alignment and professional integrity.

### Why Does Pelican AI Exist?

Because Louisiana educators tell us you're overwhelmed. You're managing:
- 15+ parent emails that take 30 minutes each to write
- Lesson planning that requires hours of curriculum analysis
- Differentiation for diverse learners with limited time
- Grading, administrative tasks, and everything else that fills your evenings and weekends

**We built Pelican AI to give you your time back** while maintaining the high standards Louisiana students deserve.

### Your Time Commitment

**During Beta:** ~1 hour per week for 8-12 weeks
- Try at least one framework per week (~10-15 minutes)
- Complete brief weekly feedback survey (~5 minutes)
- Attend one office hours session (optional but recommended)

### What You'll Gain

**Time Savings:** 3-5 hours per week reclaimed for high-impact teaching  
**Louisiana Alignment:** Every framework mapped to Louisiana standards and LER domains  
**Community Access:** Connect with fellow Louisiana educators innovating with AI  
**Founding Member Status:** Recognition when we launch publicly + lifetime access benefits
