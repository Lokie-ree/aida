# Beta Welcome Kit

**Welcome to the Pelican AI Beta Program!**

Thank you for joining us as a founding member. This guide will help you get the most value from your beta experience.

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### What is Pelican AI?

Pelican AI is a platform-agnostic AI guidance system designed specifically for Louisiana educators. We teach you how to use ANY AI tool you already have access to‚ÄîMagicSchool AI, Brisk, SchoolAI, Gemini, ChatGPT, or others‚Äîwith confidence and ethical guidelines.

We're not another software platform. We're your guide to using AI effectively while maintaining Louisiana standards alignment and professional integrity.

### Why Does Pelican AI Exist?

Because Louisiana educators tell us you're overwhelmed. You're managing:
- 15+ parent emails that take 30 minutes each to write
- Lesson planning that requires hours of curriculum analysis
- Differentiation for diverse learners with limited time
- Grading, administrative tasks, and everything else that fills your evenings and weekends

**We built Pelican AI to give you your time back** while maintaining the high standards Louisiana students deserve.

### Your Time Commitment

**During Beta:** ~1 hour per week for 8-12 weeks
- Try at least one framework per week (~10-15 minutes)
- Complete brief weekly feedback survey (~5 minutes)
- Attend one office hours session (optional but recommended)

### What You'll Gain

**Time Savings:** 3-5 hours per week reclaimed for high-impact teaching  
**Louisiana Alignment:** Every framework mapped to Louisiana standards and LER domains  
**Community Access:** Connect with fellow Louisiana educators innovating with AI  
**Founding Member Status:** Recognition when we launch publicly + lifetime access benefits

## ü§ù What We'll Build Together

This beta program is different. We're not giving you 4 pre-built frameworks. We're giving you ONE foundation framework and then **co-creating** the next ones based on YOUR actual needs.

### Why Co-Creation?

**Traditional Approach:** "Here are 10 tools. Hope one fits your needs!"  
**Our Approach:** "Here's one powerful foundation. Now show us what you're struggling with and we'll build it together."

### Your Voice Matters

Every week, we'll ask you:
- **What's your biggest pain point this week?**
- **What task took too much time?**
- **If AI could help with ONE thing, what would it be?**

Then we'll look for patterns across all 8 beta testers and build frameworks that address the challenges YOU actually face.

### Known Pain Points We're Exploring

Based on conversations with your cohort, we know you're facing:

**1. Lesson Plan Internalization & Differentiation**
- Challenge: Spending too much time copy/pasting from curriculum providers instead of adapting for your students
- Opportunity: Efficiently internalize curriculum and differentiate without straying from approved resources
- Bonus: Map math/STEM topics to student interests

**2. Data Analysis for Collaborative Meetings**
- Challenge: Turning raw assessment data into meaningful talking points
- Opportunity (For Teachers): Prepare data insights in under 10 minutes
- Opportunity (For Master Teachers): Facilitate focused, productive discussions with structured questions

**3. Tedious Task Automation**
- Challenge: Repetitive tasks consuming 30-60 minutes daily
- Opportunity: Identify and automate the highest-impact tedious tasks
- Examples: Creating problem variations, formatting materials, routine communications

**Your weekly feedback will tell us which of these (or other challenges) to prioritize.**

### The Beta Timeline

**Weeks 1-2:** Master the Lesson Objective Unpacker  
**Weeks 3-4:** Continue using it, share detailed feedback on your pain points  
**Weeks 5-6:** We analyze your feedback and prototype 1-2 new frameworks  
**Weeks 7-8:** You test the new frameworks, we refine based on your input  
**Weeks 9-12:** Finalize frameworks that truly solve YOUR problems

**This is YOUR beta program. We build what YOU need.**
