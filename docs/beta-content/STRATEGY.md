# Beta Program Strategy - Phase 1 MVP

**Date:** October 2025  
**Status:** Active  
**Approach:** Single Framework with Co-Creation Model

---

## Strategic Overview

Phase 1 focuses on **ONE foundation framework**, then co-creates additional frameworks based on beta tester pain points.

### Why Single Framework for Phase 1?

**AIB-001: Lesson Objective Unpacker** chosen as universal foundation because:
- Entry point for ALL educators regardless of district or curriculum
- Provides immediate daily value (teachers plan lessons every week)
- Teaches transferable skills: Breaking down objectives, identifying misconceptions, creating success criteria
- Builds confidence with AI-assisted planning before introducing more complex frameworks
- 3 minutes per lesson, beginner-friendly

**Time Commitment:** Weeks 1-4 (entire Phase 1 beta)

---

## Co-Creation Model

**Weeks 1-2:** Beta testers master AIB-001 using it with multiple lessons  
**Weeks 3-4:** Beta testers share detailed pain point feedback via weekly surveys  
**Weeks 5-6:** We analyze patterns and prototype 1-2 NEW frameworks addressing actual needs  
**Weeks 7-8:** Beta testers test prototypes and provide refinement feedback  
**Weeks 9-12:** Deploy finalized frameworks solving problems beta testers identified

### Beta Cohort Context

**Size:** 8 educators  
**Composition:** 6 math/STEM teachers + 2 master teachers

**Documented Pain Points:**
1. **Lesson Plan Internalization & Differentiation:** Copy/paste from curriculum providers, need efficient adaptation, want to map STEM topics to student interests
2. **Data Analysis for Cluster Meetings:** Teachers need talking points, master teachers need facilitation structure
3. **Tedious Task Automation:** Repetitive tasks consuming 30-60 minutes daily

**Decision:** Don't assume which pain points matter most. Let weekly survey data reveal priorities, then build accordingly.

---

## Why NOT Multiple Frameworks in Phase 1

**Original Plan:** Deploy 4 frameworks (AIB-001 through AIB-004) in 4 weeks  
**Problem:** AIB-002, AIB-003, AIB-004 were too district-specific (referenced Tier I curriculum, OnCourse platform, cluster meetings, internalization guides)  
**Solution:** Archive district-specific frameworks, focus on universal foundation, co-create based on actual beta tester needs

**Key Insight:** 8-person beta cohort without district partnerships needs a different approach than district-wide deployment. Build trust with ONE excellent framework, then let beta testers guide what comes next.

---

## Future Framework Decision Framework

**Phase 2 Strategy:** Don't pre-build frameworks. Let beta testers tell us what they need through weekly pain point feedback (Question 5 in weekly check-in survey).

**Decision Criteria:**
1. **Frequency:** How often do beta testers encounter this pain point?
2. **Impact:** How much time would solving it save?
3. **Alignment:** Does it fit with "academic rigor and planning" value proposition?
4. **Feasibility:** Can we create an effective AI prompt for this in 2 weeks?

## Archived Frameworks Available for Adaptation

**Location:** `archive/future-frameworks/`

These simplified, universal frameworks are ready if beta tester pain points align:

1. **AIB-002: Curriculum Pacing Assistant** - May address Pain Point #1 (lesson internalization)
2. **AIB-003: Assessment Data Analyzer** - Directly addresses Pain Point #2 (data analysis for teachers)
3. **AIB-004: Collaborative Planning Facilitator** - Directly addresses Pain Point #2 (facilitation for master teachers)

**Deployment Criteria:**
- Wait for beta testers to confirm pain point through weekly surveys (Weeks 3-4)
- Test with 2-3 beta testers before full deployment
- Refine based on their specific systems and contexts

## Deferred Parent Communication Framework

**File:** `archive/AIB-001-parent-communication-framework.md`

**Why Deferred:**
- Not all teachers write frequent parent emails
- Less universally applicable than objective unpacking
- Doesn't build foundation for academic rigor and planning skills
- Better suited for later phase when teachers are comfortable with AI

**When to Deploy:**
- Phase 2 or 3 after core planning frameworks are established
- As an optional "communication toolkit" addition
- For teachers who specifically request parent communication support
- Could be strong for parent-teacher conference season (October-November)

**Value Proposition:**
- 5 minutes per email (vs. 20-30 minutes manually)
- Professional, empathetic tone assistance
- Works for academic updates, behavioral concerns, positive news

**Potential Future Positioning:**
"Now that you're using AI for planning and instruction, let's extend it to parent communication..."

## Success Metrics to Track

Once launched, monitor these metrics weekly:

- Number of beta signups
- Welcome email open rate
- Framework click-through rate
- Post-Framework Survey response rate
- Weekly Check-In Survey response rate
- Average time saved reported
- Framework clarity ratings
- User feedback themes
