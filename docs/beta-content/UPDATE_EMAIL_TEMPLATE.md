5. Save this URL

### 2. Update the Email Template

Open `src/emails/BetaWelcomeEmail.tsx` in your code editor.

**First Update - Line 68:**

Find this line:
```tsx
<Link href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/your-framework-link-here/edit" style={ctaLink}>
```

Replace with:
```tsx
<Link href="YOUR_PARENT_COMMUNICATION_FRAMEWORK_URL" style={ctaLink}>
```

```tsx
<Link href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/your-welcome-kit-link-here/edit" style={ctaLink}>

```

### 3. Save and Deploy

```bash
# Save the file (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)

# If Convex dev is already running, changes auto-deploy
# If not, start it:
npx convex dev
```

### 4. Test the Email

{
  "name": "Test User",
  "email": "your.email@example.com",
  "school": "Test School"
}
```
5. Check your email

### 5. Verify Everything Works

## Common Issues

### Issue: "You need permission to access this document"
**Cause:** Google Doc sharing not set correctly  
**Fix:** Open the doc â†’ Share â†’ Change to "Anyone with link can view"

### Issue: Link goes to editing view instead of viewing
**Cause:** URL format  
**Fix:** Use the URL exactly as Google provides it when you click "Copy link"

### Issue: Changes not showing up
**Cause:** Convex not redeployed  
**Fix:** Make sure `npx convex dev` is running, or run `npx convex deploy` manually

### Issue: Email not sending
**Cause:** Various  
**Fix:** Check Convex logs for errors, verify Resend integration is working

## Need Help?

If you run into issues:
1. Check the Convex dashboard logs for error messages
2. Verify both Google Docs have correct sharing permissions
3. Try the links in an incognito/private browser window
4. Make sure you saved the file after making changes
