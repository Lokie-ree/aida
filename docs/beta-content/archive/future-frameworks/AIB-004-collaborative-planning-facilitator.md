## üéØ The Challenge

During collaborative planning meetings, valuable time often gets wasted:

- **Surface-Level Planning:** Groups spend too much time on basic items like vocabulary lists or material prep, missing the deeper work required in rigorous lesson analysis
- **Discussion Drift:** The meeting starts focused but devolves into off-topic conversations or venting, leaving you with no concrete takeaways
- **Inconsistent Rigor:** It's difficult to consistently maintain high-level focus on complex content, scaffolding, and differentiation
- **Vague Action Steps:** Groups leave meetings without a single, concrete takeaway to remove a learning barrier for students

Sound familiar? Your collaborative planning time is precious, but it's not consistently productive.

## üí° The AI-Powered Solution

This framework uses AI as a **Meeting Facilitator** to keep planning discussions focused on the highest-leverage questions, ensuring every meeting results in concrete, high-rigor action steps.

**Here's the process:**

1. **Gather your key information** (The lesson/content being planned, grade level, and focus area)
2. **Before the meeting:** Open any AI platform you have access to (MagicSchool AI, Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)
3. **Copy and paste the sample prompt below** with your specific information filled in
4. **Bring the AI-generated questions to your meeting** as discussion starters
5. **Use the questions to drive focused conversation** for 7-10 minutes
6. **End with the concrete action step** identified through the third question
7. **Assign ownership** for the action step before leaving the meeting

**Remember:** AI provides structure for collaboration, but the teaching expertise and student knowledge in the room is what makes the planning valuable.

## üìù Sample Prompt (Copy & Paste Ready)

```
You are a collaborative Master Teacher and PD Facilitator. Your job is to help our planning meeting stay focused on high-leverage, rigorous planning.

MEETING CONTEXT:
Lesson/Content Being Planned: [INSERT LESSON NAME OR TOPIC]
Grade Level: [INSERT GRADE]
Subject: [INSERT SUBJECT]
Curriculum: [INSERT CURRICULUM NAME if applicable]

PLANNING FOCUS:
Our team needs to dive deep into: [SELECT ONE:
- Content: Complex text or complex concept understanding
- Building Understanding: Scaffolds and supports needed
- Questions: Discussion questions or problem-solving prompts
- Scaffolding and Differentiation: Removing barriers to learning
- Planning for Students with Disabilities: Specific accommodations]

CURRENT CHALLENGE:
[DESCRIBE THE VAGUE/STUCK POINT, e.g., "We keep saying 'students will struggle with this content' but we're not identifying the SPECIFIC barrier" or "We're listing vocabulary words instead of planning how to teach them" or "We don't know which scaffold to prioritize"]

Please generate THREE high-leverage, probing questions that:
1. Push our thinking beyond surface-level review
2. Force us to focus on potential MISCONCEPTIONS and IDEAL RESPONSES
3. Result in a single, concrete, measurable action step

The third question MUST require us to identify:
- WHO on the team is responsible
- WHAT specifically will be created/prepared
- WHEN it will be ready (before the lesson is taught)

Format your response as a numbered list ready for immediate use in our meeting.
```

## üéØ Example Output

**Here's what the AI generated using the prompt above:**

> ### COLLABORATIVE PLANNING FOCUS QUESTIONS
> **Lesson:** Analyzing Character Development in Literature
> **Grade:** 5th Grade ELA  
> **Planning Focus:** Scaffolding and Differentiation
>
> ---
>
> ### üìç QUESTION 1: IDENTIFY THE MISCONCEPTION
>
> **"Based on our prior assessment data and our knowledge of these students, what is the single most likely way students will incorrectly interpret character change?"**
>
> **Why this matters:** Generic planning ("students might struggle") leads to generic teaching. Naming the SPECIFIC misconception allows us to design a targeted scaffold. 
>
> **Look for in your discussion:**
> - Is there data (exit tickets, assessment patterns) that validates this misconception?
> - Have we seen this confusion before with similar content?
> - What incorrect answer would this misconception lead to?
>
> **Example productive answer:** "Students will likely say the character 'became nicer' rather than understanding they developed empathy through loss of privilege. They'll point to surface actions (helping others) without connecting to the internal shift."
>
> ---
>
> ### üìç QUESTION 2: DEFINE THE IDEAL RESPONSE
>
> **"What is the shortest, most ideal two-sentence model response for the lesson's culminating task, and how will we use our Success Criteria to ensure we don't accept less than that standard?"**
>
> **Why this matters:** If we don't know what "good" looks like, we can't scaffold students toward it. The Success Criteria should mirror the components of the ideal response.
>
> **Look for in your discussion:**
> - Does the model response include all required elements from the standard?
> - Can we backward-plan scaffolds from this ideal response?
> - Are we clear on the difference between "acceptable" and "strong"?
>
> **Example productive answer:** 
> - **Ideal Response:** "The character develops from entitled to empathetic when they experience loss. This transformation is shown through changed actions and internal thoughts."
> - **Success Criteria:** (1) Names the change with precise adjectives, (2) Cites specific evidence, (3) Includes both external actions AND internal change
>
> ---
>
> ### üìç QUESTION 3: CREATE THE CONCRETE ACTION STEP
>
> **"What is the single most critical barrier to learning (interest/engagement, cognitive, or executive functioning) we can remove THIS WEEK for this lesson, and WHO on our team is creating WHAT specific 3-minute scaffold to address it, ready to share by WHEN?"**
>
> **Why this matters:** Meetings without action steps are just conversations. Assigning ownership and deadlines ensures follow-through.
>
> **Answer format required:**
> - **Barrier Type:** [Interest/Cognitive/Executive Functioning]
> - **Specific Barrier:** [Name it precisely]
> - **Scaffold/Solution:** [Describe the 3-minute instructional move or material]
> - **Owner:** [Name]
> - **Due Date:** [Specific date before lesson is taught]
> - **Share Method:** [How will it be shared with the team]
>
> **Example productive answer:**
> - **Barrier Type:** Cognitive
> - **Specific Barrier:** Students lack background knowledge about the historical context, making the character's situation abstract
> - **Scaffold:** A 3-minute "before reading" image slideshow (6-8 images with one-sentence captions) showing the historical context. Final slide: "How would YOU feel in this situation?"
> - **Owner:** Team member with strong visual literacy skills
> - **Due Date:** Two days before lesson
> - **Share Method:** Shared folder link by end of day
>
> ---
>
> ### ‚úÖ MEETING CLOSURE CHECKLIST
> Before your meeting ends, confirm:
> - [ ] We identified the specific misconception (Question 1)
> - [ ] We agreed on the ideal response standard (Question 2)
> - [ ] We assigned a concrete action with owner and deadline (Question 3)
> - [ ] The action step is IN SOMEONE'S CALENDAR
> - [ ] We know how success will be measured in student work

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT ETHICAL GUIDELINES

**Before you use this framework in your meetings:**

- ‚úÖ **AI structures the conversation, not the teaching** - The questions guide discussion, but your team's expertise drives the answers
- ‚úÖ **Adapt for your context** - This framework is customizable. Modify the prompt to fit your planning protocols.
- ‚úÖ **Protect student privacy** - When discussing student needs in your prompt, use general patterns ("students in this grade level"), not individual student names
- ‚úÖ **All team members must consent** - Before using AI-generated questions in a collaborative meeting, ensure your team is comfortable with this approach
- ‚úÖ **You can generate questions in advance OR live** - Some teams prefer the facilitator to prepare questions before the meeting; others like generating them together in real-time
- ‚úÖ **The action step comes from humans** - AI can suggest the question structure, but your team's collective judgment determines the actual scaffold/action

**You are the professionals. The AI is your meeting facilitator, not your curriculum expert.**

## üí° Tips & Variations

**For New Curriculum:**
If your team is planning with an unfamiliar curriculum:
- Add to the prompt: "Our team is new to this curriculum. Generate questions that help us identify teaching moves we should rehearse before the lesson."
- Focus extra time on Question 2 (ideal responses) to calibrate expectations

**For Experienced Teams:**
If your team has strong collaboration already:
- Skip Question 1 or make it more advanced: "How will our strongest students misunderstand this in a sophisticated way?"
- Add a Question 4: "What extension will we offer to students who master this quickly?"

**For Teams That Drift Off-Topic:**
Use the AI questions as a **timed agenda**:
- Print the 3 questions and post them visibly
- Set a timer: 7 minutes per question (21 minutes total)
- The third question's action step is your meeting deliverable

**For Remote/Hybrid Meetings:**
The structure works even better virtually:
- Paste the questions into the meeting chat
- Use breakout rooms for Question 1 and 2 (small group discussion)
- Come back together for Question 3 (whole group action planning)

**For Differentiated Planning:**
If different teachers need different depths:
- Novice teachers: Focus on Question 2 (ideal responses and success criteria)
- Experienced teachers: Focus on Question 1 (misconceptions) and Question 3 (advanced scaffolds)

**For Leadership/Instructional Coaches:**
If you facilitate planning meetings:
- Generate questions in advance and bring them printed
- Use them as your facilitator guide to redirect off-topic conversation
- Close every meeting by photographing the completed Question 3 action step and emailing it to the team

**Platform-Specific Notes:**  
None needed‚Äîthis prompt works universally across all AI platforms.
