## üéØ The Challenge

The **Curriculum District Assessments (CDAs)** administered via **OnCourse** provide a mountain of data, which is great‚Äîbut turning that data into an actionable re-teach plan is crippling:

- **Analysis Paralysis:** You get the item analysis and standards breakdown, but translating rows of percentages into a concise summary of *why* students missed questions is time-consuming
- **The Re-teach Mandate:** District policy requires you to "analyze assessment data (item analysis, standards analysis)" and "reteach students as necessary"‚Äîthis is where the manual time drain occurs
- **Communication Pressure:** You need to articulate precise student needs to school leaders and parents, but creating data-driven summaries takes 30+ minutes
- **Distractor Analysis Overwhelm:** You know the wrong answers reveal misconceptions, but systematically analyzing which distractors students chose across 40+ items is exhausting

Sound familiar? You want to be data-driven, but data analysis consumes the time you need for actual re-teaching.

## üí° The AI-Powered Solution

This framework uses AI to ingest your raw CDA data and instantly synthesize the key instructional takeaways, transforming a 45-minute manual data analysis session into a 5-minute action plan.

**Here's the process:**

1. **Gather your key information** (3 lowest-performing standards, 3 most-missed item numbers, common incorrect answer choices/distractors)
2. **Open any AI platform** you have access to (MagicSchool AI, Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)
3. **Copy and paste the sample prompt below** with your specific data filled in
4. **Review the AI analysis** carefully, cross-referencing with your knowledge of student needs
5. **Customize the re-teach plan** based on your professional judgment
6. **Implement the targeted intervention** with confidence

**Remember:** AI accelerates analysis, but you make the final instructional decisions. Your knowledge of individual student needs and classroom dynamics is irreplaceable.

## üìù Sample Prompt (Copy & Paste Ready)

```
You are a data-driven Instructional Coach helping me turn my CDA assessment results into an actionable re-teach plan.

ASSESSMENT CONTEXT:
Grade Level: [INSERT GRADE]
Subject: [INSERT SUBJECT]
Assessment: [INSERT CDA NAME/NUMBER]
Number of Students: [INSERT NUMBER]

DATA SUMMARY:
3 Lowest-Performing Standards:
1. [INSERT STANDARD, e.g., "8.RL.3 - Analyze how particular lines of dialogue or incidents propel action"]
2. [INSERT STANDARD]
3. [INSERT STANDARD]

3 Most-Missed Questions:
- Item #[X]: [Brief description of question type] - [X]% correct
- Item #[Y]: [Brief description] - [Y]% correct  
- Item #[Z]: [Brief description] - [Z]% correct

Common Incorrect Answers (Distractors):
[DESCRIBE PATTERNS, e.g., "For Item 12, 67% chose option B (literal detail) instead of option D (inferential theme). For Item 18, students confused cause/effect with comparison/contrast."]

Please provide THREE distinct outputs:

1. TWO-SENTENCE SUMMARY: What is the core student weakness revealed by this data?

2. RE-TEACH PLAN: Create a focused 3-step plan that addresses the misconception demonstrated by the most common distractors. Focus on NEW practice problems, not re-administering the same test items.

3. ADMINISTRATOR COMMUNICATION: Draft one professional paragraph I can share with school leadership explaining the data pattern, the planned intervention, and expected outcomes. Use data-driven language appropriate for formal communication.

## üìä Example Output

**Here's what the AI generated using the prompt above:**

> ### CDA DATA ANALYSIS - 8th Grade ELA, CDA #2
>
> ---
>
> ### üìå TWO-SENTENCE SUMMARY
>
> Students are primarily struggling to differentiate between **theme and main idea**, consistently selecting literal details (what happened) instead of inferential interpretations (what it means). This challenge is compounded by weak command of complex sentence structures (8.L.1), making it difficult for students to process the nuanced language in which theme is typically embedded in grade-level texts.
>
> ---
>
> ### üéØ RE-TEACH PLAN (3 Steps)
>
> **MISCONCEPTION TO ADDRESS:** Students believe theme is a summary of events rather than an insight about life/human nature that the text reveals.
>
> **Step 1: Isolate the Skills (Day 1 - 20 minutes)**
> - Use a simple, familiar fable (not from the test) where theme is obvious
> - Create a two-column chart: "What Happened" vs. "What It Teaches About Life"
> - Explicitly name: Column 1 = summary/main idea, Column 2 = theme
> - Practice with 3 short examples, increasing complexity
> - **Success Criteria:** Students can explain the difference in their own words
>
> **Step 2: Apply to Complex Text (Day 2 - 30 minutes)**
> - Provide a new grade-level passage with similar complexity to CDA items
> - Students identify 2 literal details and 1 theme
> - Use sentence frames: "The story shows that [theme] through the character's [specific action/dialogue]"
> - Address grammar component: Practice embedding evidence in complex sentences
> - **Success Criteria:** 80% of students correctly identify theme (not plot summary)
>
> **Step 3: Assess and Differentiate (Day 3 - 25 minutes)**
> - Give 5 theme-focused practice items mirroring CDA format
> - Students who score 80%+ move to extension (comparing themes across texts)
> - Students who score below 80% receive small-group re-teaching using graphic organizers
> - **Success Criteria:** Ready for retest administration
>
> **MATERIALS NEEDED:**
> - 1 simple fable (5-7 sentences)
> - 1 grade-level passage (200-300 words) NOT from the original CDA
> - 5 new practice items with distractors similar to CDA patterns
> - Theme vs. Main Idea anchor chart
>
> ---
>
> ### üíº ADMINISTRATOR COMMUNICATION (Draft)
>
> Following analysis of CDA #2 results, I identified a critical pattern: 68% of students scored below proficiency on standard 8.RL.3 (theme analysis), with item analysis revealing that students consistently selected literal detail distractors rather than inferential theme responses across Items 12, 18, and 24. The data indicates students conflate plot summary with thematic interpretation. I will implement a targeted 3-day re-teach cycle (October 16-18) focusing on explicit differentiation between main idea and theme, supported by structured practice with new text exemplars and sentence-level grammar scaffolding to address the compounding issue revealed in 8.L.1 performance. Based on this intervention design, I anticipate 75-80% proficiency on the retest, scheduled for October 20, which aligns with our goal of ensuring all students demonstrate grade-level mastery before the next benchmark assessment.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT ETHICAL GUIDELINES

**Before you implement any AI-generated analysis:**

- ‚úÖ **Verify all data entry** - Double-check that you input standards and item numbers correctly
- ‚úÖ **Protect student privacy** - Never input student names or personally identifiable information. Use aggregate data only.
- ‚úÖ **Cross-reference with actual test items** - AI cannot see your assessment. Confirm its analysis aligns with what the questions actually tested.
- ‚úÖ **Adjust for classroom context** - AI doesn't know about recent absences, field trips, or other factors affecting performance
- ‚úÖ **You own the re-teach decisions** - The suggested plan is a starting point. Modify based on available time, resources, and student relationships.
- ‚úÖ **Communicate transparently** - If sharing AI-drafted communication with admin, review and personalize it so it authentically represents your voice and analysis

**You are the professional. The AI is your analysis accelerator, not your instructional decision-maker.**

## üí° Tips & Variations

**For Item-Level Deep Dive:**
If one question reveals a critical gap:
- Focus the prompt on a single item: "Item 12 showed only 23% proficiency. Based on the standard [X] and common distractor [Y], what specific skill is missing?"
- Ask for 5 new practice problems targeting that exact skill

**For Standards Clustering:**
If multiple low-performing standards are related:
- "Standards 8.RL.2, 8.RL.3, and 8.L.4 all performed below 60%. What is the common underlying skill deficit connecting these three?"
- Helps you create one integrated re-teach rather than three separate interventions

**For Parent Communication:**
Adapt the administrator communication for families:
- "Rewrite the administrator communication in parent-friendly language, avoiding educational jargon, and focusing on what parents can do at home to support the re-teach."

**For Retest Planning:**
After re-teaching, use AI for retest design:
- "Create 5 practice items targeting [standard] that mirror CDA rigor but use different texts/contexts. Include 3 distractors per item, with one distractor targeting the misconception we addressed in re-teaching."

**For Collaborative Planning:**
In PLCs or grade-level teams:
- Have each teacher input their class data separately, then compare AI summaries
- Identify school-wide vs. classroom-specific patterns
- Make collaborative decisions about which misconceptions need building-level intervention

**Platform-Specific Notes:**  
None needed‚Äîthis prompt works universally across all AI platforms.
